```
* [name=Name]
 ðŸŒ¹ = Something great that happened (a rose!)
 ðŸŒµ = Something not-so-great that happened (a thorn!)
 ðŸŒ± = Something you're looking forward to (a bud!)
```

[name=Sophia] 
* ðŸŒ¹ = Got some great feedback and had really good discussions about the draft content in TTW Collab Cafe. 
* ðŸŒµ = Am a bit behind on where I wanted to be for the TTW chapter and need to finish a section a day to be able to stick to the timelime so am a bit stressy. I also may have tried to up my hours too fast and am trying to manage self care (and ankle rehab) appropriately now that I'm *almost* back at full time. 
* ðŸŒ± = Getting reviews on the content :star: it's always great when you get input and perspective on pieces of writing and it can massively help to improve it. 
 
[name=Vicky] 
* ðŸŒ¹ = Draft for the Turing-Roche stand at AI UK coming along well 
* ðŸŒµ = Really struggling to juggle workload at the moment 
* ðŸŒ± = Looking forward to the first scholars cohort call this afternoon
 
[name=Eirini] 
* ðŸŒ¹ = We've had a great response to the ECR day 
* ðŸŒµ = People change their mind about whether they're coming more than I would like. Also, dinner for 30 people is difficult :sweat_smile: 
* ðŸŒ± = Excited to be going back to where I did my PhD to talk about career stuff + the Turing Way :blue_heart: 
 
[name=Ayesha] 
* ðŸŒ¹ = Moved across to my new role in EDI/Widening Participation - exciting new start (though also tinged with sadness at leaving behind my old projects, especially the DSAIEP, which was like my project 'baby').
* ðŸŒµ = I recently contracted a cold and have been feeling a little under the weather :mask: FOMO over the weekend is rubbish!
* ðŸŒ± = Working on exciting new projects that have enormous impact on young people!
 
[name=Cass] 
* ðŸŒ¹ = Practicing staying in the strategy space and makeing it clear where my expertise are/aren't!
* ðŸŒµ = Dealing with the clash of the deadlines!
* ðŸŒ± = Planning for [Climate Informatics 2024](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/climate-informatics-2024/)

[name=Malvika Sharan]
* ðŸŒ¹ = Three conference keynotes and the SPA Workshop (well done Emma!). Also happy to be home for an entire month uninterrupted. Working on objectives for myself and others in the team.
* ðŸŒµ = Slowness and unclear expectations of RCM recruitments.
* ðŸŒ± = RCM-Wiki day, making time for some writing (paper, TTW).

[name=Emma]
* ðŸŒ¹ = Did the data roles workshop - glad that is done :sweat_smile: 
* ðŸŒµ = Got a very long to do list now - getting through it but slowly.
* ðŸŒ± = RCM wiki day, also looking forward to making space for writing - I have been saying no to things to make space but not sure if I can keep that up! 
 
[name=Gabin]
* ðŸŒ¹ = DCE is receiving quite some boost in terms of visibility, through ADViCE: Downing St has decided to have it as one of its flagship programmes ahead of the UK AI summit   
* ðŸŒµ = Down with flu (not covid) the past few days...
* ðŸŒ± = ...but on the mend now :crossed_fingers: 

[name=Anne]
* ðŸŒ¹ = Sun is out today here in London :sun_with_face: 
* ðŸŒµ = Monday has been full of juggling upcoming events and commitments, a few talks and upcoming workshops. Just starting to feel manageable again after feeling like I was burried last week. 
* ðŸŒ± = Team day and meeting my Enrichment Student mentee
 
[name=Clau] 
* ðŸŒ¹ = SUN!
* ðŸŒµ = Lots of projects so juggling to many things.
* ðŸŒ± = This is bitter sweet, but I'm leaving the Turing. I'm quite excited for new challenges but also sad to leave Turing.
 
### Notes

> *If the assigned documentarian, please write meeting notes here*
#### Skills Policy Award update
* ==[slides]==
* Thanks to Alex and Malvika - Team effort!
* Project came from call for training funding (not funding for research projects)
    * Thinking about skills in the policy landscape
        * Professionalisation around data science roles
        * Widening participation
        * Organisational capacity
    * 4 projects selected, inc Emma/Malvika's
        * [See awards](https://www.turing.ac.uk/skills-policy-awards-20232024)
* Award pays for a little bit of your time (20% Emma, 10% Malvika), a mentor and training in policy skills.
* Good experience if you've never been a PI. Emma's mentor is well-regarded and has provided really helpful support in refining the project
* Awardees will receive training on how to get policies into Government
* Call followed National Data Strategy, which speaks a lot to the need for Research Infrastructure Roles
* Emma and Malvika are drafting a position paper on Research Community Management
    * Now looking for an illustrator, preprint in the next few months
* Primary outcome is a policy briefing note, to influence government.
* Emma is working closely with the Turing Skills Team, REG (they are thinking about their skills and competencies framework, to understand training needs) and Partnership Team (super helpful for multi-stakeholder workshops, connecting you to new contacts)
* Outside of Turing: Rachel Hilliam, Alliance for Data Science Professionals, Data Skills Task Force, Royal Society
* Emma is enjoying the wider group and getting to meet and speak with new people
* Data Skills Task Force
    * Commissioned by Government
    * Primarily industry focused
    * Working at senior level, and not grass-roots (like us)
    * Turing is a partner
* Alliance for Data Science Professionals
    * Came from Royal Society, then government backing
    * Turing is a partner
    * Developing 2 levels of accreditation for data science professionals
* Both of these groups are working at a high level, so we are adding value by consulting people on the ground.
* Emma ran a workshop last week, focussing on Research Infrastructure Roles (RIRs) and emerging skills need
    * Need for research quality and confidence in implementing open research practices
    * Research sustainability - cost-effective and climate positive
    * Interdisciplinarity - bringing lots of domains together is difficult
    * EDIA
* The above challenges means we need more specialists in these areas to drive the research and makes the research impactful and high quality!
* Started thinking from RCM skills (==[skills wheel links]==), then aimed to develop their own skills framework
* Core Skill Areas for RCMs
    * If we're in a big team, then our skills will overlap - what are the core skills which will define our role?
        * All data science professionals will have "core", RCMs will have specific focus on communications and engagement
         * These were then mapped onto Alliance standards, then extended.
    * Tried to anchor on standards which have already been created - retrofitting their recommendations 
* Hybrid national workshop last week, n=48
    * Mixed group, most of whom were meeting for the first time
    * Feedback that the time passed really quickly, so they enjoyed it!
    * Task 1: to pick a role and discuss core skills for that role
        * Mixed success on actually doing this - a lot of valuable discussion
    * Task 2: understand what the varied careers look like in different roles
        * Seemed better mapped in industry
* Next Steps:
    * Write up of workshop for github repo
    * Interviews to gather case studies
    * Writing "massive" policy briefing note (December)
    * Collaborating on other role skill descriptions
* Sector-specific skill gap vs community-specific skills gap
    * Remember that Emma's work is related to professional skill requirements, and this is quite different from understanding skills gaps in your community.
