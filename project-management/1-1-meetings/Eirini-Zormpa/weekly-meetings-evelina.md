## Date: 23 November 2022

### Check-in ritual
I finally reached to PG who offered to help out with AIM training in the survey ‚ú®

### Project specific Reflection
Not much has changed since Friday üòÖ The data viz workshop went well and I got some really lovely feedback from two attendees at the beginning of the session ü•∞

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

- Planning ECR events and Collab Cafes in 2023.
- SB helped me set up an all-contributors bot for the training workshop. The idea is to acknowledge learners, helpers and instuctors that participate in the workshops. Do you have a preference on creating custom roles for these are trying to repurpose existing ones ([emoji-key](https://allcontributors.org/docs/en/emoji-key)?

#### Who did you help this week?
I'm not sure üôà

#### Who helped you this week?

RK and EM helped out with the data viz workshop :blush:

#### What did you achieve?

- I prepped for the data viz workshop and delivered it.
- I reached out to DynAIRx and it turns out they do have new hires! I'm waiting on a list from their project manager and I'll try to set up meetings with them. I'm also trying to set up a meeting with their new project manager as I haven't met them yet.

#### What did you struggle with?

- Prep for the data viz was kind of difficult this time - the visualisations were somehow not working as I was expecting them to. I mostly figured things out but there was a thing that should have worked that in the live demo didn't and that was quite annoying.
- I'm conscious that I still haven't written up the survey outcomes üò¨

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- Upload the materials from the workshop
- Prep for the workshop in December
- Make a list of the things I need to do once I'm back
- See if I can make any progress on the survey
- Plan events in 2023 (I also have a meeting with DC and SB about this)

#### Where do you need help?

- The R workshops have taken up most of my attention recently - is there something I have been neglecting?

#### Any other topics

## Date: 2 November 2022

### Check-in ritual
Massive respect to all the attendees in yesterday's R workshop who, somehow, did not make typos???? ü§Ø

### Project specific Reflection
Last week was pretty busy: I did a lot of work 1) restructuring repos to share more information with AIM members and doing so in a GDPR-compliant way and 2) getting ready for the R workshops, which at least for yesterday seems to have paid out ‚ú®

## Date: 19 October 2022

### Project specific Reflection

- Things have been alright - I've been working on the GitHub workshop for yesterday afternoon mostly. It honestly didn't go as well as I would have liked, but at least we can learn from the things that went wrong.
- Being in the office on Thursday and Friday last week stole a lot of the focus time I had reserved üò¢
- I started having weekly meetings with SB and DC on Monday which is nice!

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

- Lessons learned from yesterday's GitHub workshop: we mostly had issues with write access in the repos: the general AIM consortia team didn't give write access to any of the repo + external folk that we couldn't add as members in the organisation had to work with forks.
- People are being interviewed for RSF positions :tada:

- RS was a huge help in the workshop yesterday

#### What did you achieve?

- Did lots of prep work on the GitHub workshop
- Delivered the GitHub workshop. Despite the difficulties we did get people to make a commit and submit pull requests! We have 6 merged already, 3 approved and 1 that still needs to be edited. So all in all just over half of the attendees? I'll email the slides to everyone and remind them they can come get help at the Collab Cafe tomorrow.
- Linked up with the MRC (!) Statistics CoP on MLTC who in turn introduced me to the NIHR Statistics CoP ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

#### What did you struggle with?

- I have not made any progress on the survey. I was in the office at the time I was planning on working on it and it's not great for focused work.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

- Survey (3rd time lucky? ü§û)
- Collab Cafe
- Do some documentation writing on running events

#### Where do you need help?

- I keep waiting to fix the survey a bit more before I share it, but I guess I might just give up and share it right after I commit this.

#### Any other topics

- I've joined a Code Club to get a bit better on my R skills (it's about writing functions, creating packages etc)

## Date: 12 October 2022

### Check-in ritual
I asked three people from the AIM consortia to help out with the R sessions and they all said yes ü•∞

### Project specific Reflection
Last week was pretty full on with non-RSF things: the King's talk, TTW Collab Cafe, OLS, a panel I'm doing for the SSI. Since Monday I've been focusing on RSF things, which has been lovely.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1

- CO can't make it to the Collab Cafe next week after all - the plan was to discuss data ethics applications and a couple of the project managers said they'd be there to discuss that. Any tips on how to approach that?

- I advertised the R workshops yesterday and got 12 sign ups

#### What did you struggle with?

* I've been trying to stick to 9:00-17:30 and pomodoro everything. I like it when it works but it doesn't come naturally.

#### What would you like to work on next week?

* Actually finish making the plots for the survey and start working on the text.
    * I'm sorry I forgot to share it, will do so ASAP

## Date: 5 October 2022

### Check-in ritual
I had some really nice responses from people about working on data ethics applications in the Collab Cafe :sparkles:

### Project specific Reflection
Things have been good if stressful - I was kind of out of commission by the end of last week. This week I've been working on advertising GitHub training this month and analysing the survey data to present in the ECR session on Thursday.

### Notes to discuss during 1:1
- I'm hoping to use the survey as a way to start a more general conversation either about training or about reproducible documents (it's in R Markdown) - any tips on how to get that started?
- I've been struggling to find time to reach out to consortia and I end up leading/presenting at more events than I would like. Any ideas about people/topics for ECR events or people to help out with R training would be super helpful!

I had a lovely conversation with one of the project managers about sharing code while preserving data privacy.

- Though I will need help with what I just mentioned and it *is* one of my main responsibilities, I still feel like it'll take a couple of weeks before I'm at a place to actually start doing that. Some help getting a feel of my priorities would be great!
