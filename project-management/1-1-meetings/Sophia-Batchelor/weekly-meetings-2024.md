### Notes
* there is a benefit to both curating resources (youtube playlist/other resources) **AND** a "live" session/synchronous experience which gives the option to ask questions
* Connect with Emma and see if some ECRs would be interested in the opportunity of getting experience in sci-comm and connecting with members of the public
  * We could make a more targetted call next month once we have some more refined topics to present about (i.e. the topics that folks want to hear about)
* open the door for suggestions and input about what internal sessions Theme 4 can run to support us for the conference
  * Pop note in the Ops meeting notes.
