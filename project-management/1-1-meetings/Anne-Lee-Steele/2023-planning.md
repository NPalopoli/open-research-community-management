## Proposal for meeting cadence:
- Weekly TTW Stand-up (Monday, 11-am BST): ALS sends Written progress updates with key questions. Can be reviewed on Monday by MS?
  - Key issue: Other TTW team members may need MS for questions and discussions in real time.
  - Proposal: Expand time of stand-up?
  - Develop template for team (grabbing AB's template for TPS)
- Fortnightly 1:1 (Tuesday, 4-5pm):
  - Key issue: Is 1-month timeline enough?
  - I could use this time for written reflection during the off weeks?
- 3 months: Career Strategy + Goals
  - Blue sky discussions
  - Feedback, Discussions, Format
- Planning for meeting with KW + MS: Feb
- Practitioners Hub Meeting: JS, AA, MS, AB, MS, ALS

## Quarterly meetings


### 06-06-2023

- Feedback from annual review
  - Social science - pro! but also weakness! 
  - Working long hours, and juggling lots of things 
  - Be confident in cancelling meetings! 
  - Working groups: were supported in created them, roles is not established, processes are not clear for staff and don't have clear direction
    - When do you step in and when do you step back?
    - Tied to ethnographic experience - not sure what to do next
    - CM is sometimes filling the gap where where community needs help, and then pass it on to the community (but give a framework)
    - Check-in list with working groups & discussions: this has stalled in the time since
- Reviewing calendar and schedules
  - Ongoing recurring calls
  - Recurring responsibilities
- Reviewing agendas: core team & core delivery team
  -
