# Team Meetings

As a team, we commit to collaborate, support and interconnect our projects with each other.
As we continue to grow in our roles as community builders, technical skills, domain expertise and tips and tricks for working effectively in community and research spaces grows with it.
Team meetings are a space for all members of the group to come together and learn from each other.

Team meetings are held bi-weekly with optional co-working in the week with no meeting. 
Members from collaborating project can choose to attend the meeting biweekly, however they should maintain regular participation for consistency.
Meetings will be conducted online and remote participation will be considered by default, but when possible and safe to travel, in-person meetings will be organised at The Alan Turing Institute.
Our [shared calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=cGtlazVnc2xkcjlwYWRhNjc4MTJyaGtiaW9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) will be updated with the times of the meetings, and when meetings are cancelled because they conflict with a relevant event that multiple team members may wish to attend.

**Every team member is expected to participate in the team meetings.**
This doesn't mean you have to attend every one, but it does mean that you are expected to complete the HackMD with your attendance or apologies, and to complete project updates icebreaker questions.

This document will talk you through the expectations for participation [before](#preparing-for-team-meeting), [during](#participation-during-team-meeting) and [after](#after-team-meeting) team meeting.
There is also a long [motivation](#motivation) section about why we've designed the meetings this way.

## Participation in team meeting

### Regular attendance

I ask for regular attendance from current team members.
One hour meetings are not enough to effectively collaborate together.
Especially when many of the projects the team works on require quite different domain expertise and respective teams.
Please use team meetings as place to surface opportunities for collaboration and interconnections of your projects/work.

Importantly, participation does not exclusively mean attending the meeting.
Completing the HackMD in advance and sending apologies is sufficient to count as an active participant.

Team meeting will be organised and chaired in rotation by different team members who take the role of goathearder.
Team meeting will only be cancelled if there is another event that multiple team members are encouraged to attend.

### Preparing for team meeting

In advance of each week's team meeting, the goatherder will send a notification with a link to a HackMD note.

HackMD is a realtime, multi-platform collaborative markdown note editor.
Everyone is able to edit the text in [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) when you click the the `edit` page, and HackMD renders the raw input as a nicely formatted website in the `view` rendering.
You can see the raw markdown and the rendered page side by side by clicking the `both` button.
You can read more about HackMD at [https://hackmd.io/s/features](https://hackmd.io/s/features).

The template for each team meeting is below, and you can read more about why we have this format in the [motivation](#motivation) section at the end of this page.

When you receive the HackMD link, please add your name under **Attendees** or **Apologies**.
This lets the goatherder know that you've received the email and acknowledges that week's meeting.
It also means the goatherder knows who to wait for at the start of the meeting.

In advance of the meeting, please also complete the section on **Project updates**

For ideas about what to write (and most importantly, to make sure you know _why_ we ask these questions) see the [motivation](#motivation) section below.

You can put the ðŸ“¢ emoji next to your bullet point if you would like that update to be shared publicly.
You can leave comments, reactions, recommendations or feedback (when asked) or reply below what others have shared.

Please also read the **Agenda** section at the end of the HackMD for particular theme for the respective week's discussion.

### Participation during team meeting

Our team meetings are one hour long.
Please arrive on time or let the session chair know if you will be delayed.

#### Review of celebrations, shared resources, and questions

The chair will read through that week's HackMD, starting with the topics you've shared and then covering the questions and points you'd like the group's thoughts on.
They will go quite fast through each of these points, but also encourage members of the team to expand on their updates and questions if they would like to.

This part of team meeting should take **around 10-15 minutes**.
Everyone is encouraged to add links and resources as "sub-bullet points" (bullet points that are rendered as falling within the original point) before, during and after the meeting.

#### Specific agenda

The meeting will have a specific theme, please suggest themes in the [asks and offers](./asks-and-offers.md) document.
After the chair has gone through the week's HackMD notes, remaining time (**approx 45 minutes**) will be used for that discussion or presentation.

#### Open agenda

If the meeting is "open agenda" then the chair, in collaboration with all present team members, will select key points from the review of the bullet points in the HackMD to discuss in more depth for the remaining **45 minutes**.

### After team meeting

After the team meeting, the chair is asked to provide a few sentences summarising the discussions and provide any useful resource to share on the project reporsitory in the [resources for reference](./resources-for-reference.md) file.
This is also an opportunity to update the [Asks and Offers](./asks-and-offers.md) document for the future reference.

Remember to include any points that have the loudspeaker emoji next to them.
Use your best judgement when publicly sharing questions and comments that show particular vulnerability of the team members participating in the conversation.

Everyone who participated in the meeting is encouraged to [review the pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-reviews), specifically when assigned/requested by the chair and approve before the next team meeting.

### Chairing team meeting

Everyone is expected to chair team meeting on a rotating schedule.

Your responsibilities as chair are to:

1. Circulate the HackMD on the Monday before your team meeting.
2. Plan an agenda for the meeting and check who will be speaking.
3. Facilitate the conversation during the meeting. This includes making sure that everyone has a chance to participate, and that everyone complies with the [code of conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
4. Write a summary and add it to [resources for reference](./resources-for-reference.md) file as a Pull Request by the Monday after team meeting.

**The prospect of chairing team meeting might feel really overwhelming!**
Being in charge of managing the time, coordinating everyone's participation and facilitating a productive conversation is a lot of responsibility :grimacing:
It is also a really important skill that will serve you well in future collaborations and as you advance through your career (inside of academia and beyond).

The first few times that you chair team meeting, please be in touch with Malvika, so she can answer any questions and mentor you though the experience.

## Motivation

This last section describes the structure of the team meeting drafted by Kirstie Whitaker, particularly focusing on the reasoning behind having the questions in each week's HackMD note.

If you have any suggestions on additional points to cover or different phrasings, please let me know!

### Trust and the power of decentralised networks

There is a great risk that the projects in the group are siloed and that your project lead or line manager becomes a bottle neck for communication.
This is a **centralised** network (A in the diagram below).
In contrast, a **decentralised** network (B) shares information more effectively.
[Small world networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network) in particular are efficient and resilient.

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2e/Decentralization_diagram.svg/300px-Decentralization_diagram.svg.png)

*Decentralization diagram uploaded to [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Decentralization_diagram.svg) by Adam Aladdin. Reused under a CC-BY license.*

I would like this team to be as decentralised as possible.
I would like team members to **find the answers to their questions quickly and receive help and support from all other team members** in all dimensions.

One of the core goals of all team member is to improve collaboration (in academia and in the world!)
And a core requirement of effective collaboration is **trust**.
In fact, there was an article in the Harvard Business Review in 2011 that named trust as the ["The One Thing That Makes collaboration Work"](https://hbr.org/2011/07/one-thing-that-makes-collaboration).

Building trust is a difficult and multi-dimensional, but by being vulnerable with each other is one core component.
In her book [Emergent Strategy](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/29633913-emergent-strategy), and in [this blog post](http://adriennemareebrown.net/2013/12/14/principles-of-emergent-processes-in-facilitation/) from 2013, [adrienne maree brown](http://adriennemareebrown.net/) describes the following principles:

> lao tzu says "if you donâ€™t trust the people, they become untrustworthy."
> the first principle is a positive flip of this statement â€“ if you trust the people, they become trustworthy.
> trust is a seed that grows with attention and space.
> the facilitator can be a gardener, or the sun, the water.
> there is a conversation in the room that wants and needs to be had.
> don't force it, don't deny it.
> let it come forth.
> the connection between the individuals is what makes the whole group/community strong.

*(Note that brown [self determines](http://adriennemareebrown.net/2016/09/11/941am-911/#comment-1415562) what she capitalises, which reminds me of - and is possibly inspired by - black feminist writer [bell hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_hooks) who did not capitalise her name in order ["to focus on the substance of her work, not who [she] is"]().)*

If we want information to flow around a decentralised network, then we need to trust each other.
I believe that **building connections between individual people are the magic that will lead to the most exciting and innovative data science**.

### Something to share

> *Personal and project related highlights (celebration, success, failures and everything in between).*

If five people come to team meeting, every week for four weeks, and each time they share something interesting, we'll curate 20 content recommendations in just one month.
I'm willing to bet that at least 1 in those 20 will be useful for the team.
So the first reason to ask people to share some information is to do exactly that: **share knowledge**.

People are often uncomfortable celebrating their successes.
And that is a limitation on the goal of sharing knowledge.
Both [imposter syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) and the [Dunningâ€“Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) can stop people from sharing skills and resources that they know.
They may not recognise their strengths, or know how much they don't know and therefore keep quite while others speak much more.
The second goal of sharing something every week is to have **team members build confidence in their expertise**.
Everyone has something to contribute.

And finally, it feels really good to celebrate others' achievements!
Leaving a little :sparkling_heart:, :raised_hands: or :rocket: emoji, or maybe even a few words of congratulations makes you feel good.
This third goals is to help us all see the progress along a career that is generally rewarded at the end of very long term timescales (a paper takes years to write, and a thesis even more so).
**Stopping once per week to recognise what we've all achieved will help us all along the long research road.**

### Asking questions

> *What would you like team members' opinion(s) on?*

Asking questions is the first step in finding the answers.
If team members do not ask for help in the first place, then the communities will not be able to support them.
One goal of this section in the team meeting HackMD is to **unblock team members so they can move forwards on with their work**.

Responses to a question might be:

* To share a piece of code so they don't need to write it again.
* To share a relevant publication or blog post.
* To share a tutorial that explains how to use a software tool.
* To put the team member in touch with an expert in the field they're investigating.
* To share a similar experience and what went right (or wrong) that time.

Asking questions is also a learned skill.
Analogous to a [Minimal worked example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) it takes time and practice to distill your question from "It doesn't work" or "I don't know what to do" to a specific "I get this error message when I run this command", "I'm stuck on interpreting this figure", "How do I manage this particular challenging community interaction", or "Where should I store my data".
In many cases, it is in creating the question in the first place that you figure out what you need to know.

So the secondary goal of this section is to **help you ask good questions**.

This illustration from her blog post on ["How To Ask Good Questions"](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/) is wonderful.
(The blog post is great too!) 
Just don't let it trick you into thinking that the only good questions are related to technical expertise.
The hardest and most important questions are about **how we plan and design, undertake, and communicate our research** rather than "just" the software tools and datasets they contain.

*[How to ask good questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/good-questions/) by [Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca)*

### Distributed contributions

Many of the projects that each member is involved in are distributed around the world.
Many of us are not co-located and so it is important to find ways to share expertise and build connections and trust from afar.

The HackMD and Zoom links allows team members to contribute without being physically in the room.

The HackMD also allows team members to contribute **even if they are not able to join the meeting**.
That way, we can hear updates from them and get answers to our questions, even if our collaborators are not able to join the conversation in real time.

Finally, the HackMD lets **everyone talk at once**.
You can find links and add comments as the conversation in the room is ongoing, which allows parallel participation rather than waiting to speak in a serial timeline.

## Thank you

I really appreciate your participation in the team.
We couldn't do the exciting work without you.
