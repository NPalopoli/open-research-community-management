# Ways of Working

This document provides the structure and organisation of the Open Research Community Building Team, clarifying expectations and support structure enabling their work.

## Working Open

As members of the Open Research Community Building Team, we are dedicated to working as openly as possible. 
We believe that our endeavours will be more successful through clear communication and collaboration than by keeping secrets. 
This document (and the entire repository) is designed to showcase our "work in progress". 
You're welcome to help out along the way!

We may have private repositories if our collaborators and collaborating projects are more comfortable with restricted working on some projects, but we aspire to "be the change" and demonstrate open working practices wherever possible.

## Onboarding

If you're new to the team, your line manager or community team mentor will open the [Induction and Onboarding issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/community-manager-team/issues/new/choose), which will provide a checklist for you to work through with them. It provides a list of different actions for your first days or week in the team. 

Please make sure you have been added to the [shared calendar for the community managers](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=cGtlazVnc2xkcjlwYWRhNjc4MTJyaGtiaW9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ).

## Reporting

- Community Managers report to [Malvika Sharan](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/malvika-sharan), [Emma Karoune](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/research-associates/emma-karoune), or [Arron Lacey](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/arron-lacey).
- Senior Community Managers report to [Kirstie Whitaker](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kirstie-whitaker), TPS Director.
- Malvika Sharan, along with other TPS senior researchers report directly to Kirstie Whitaker.
- Members from collaborating projects report to their respective line managers.

## Working as a *The Turing Way* Core Member

*The Turing Way* ([the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)) is a handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science.

Everyone interested in the project is welcome to use and contribute to the project as described in [*The Turing Way* contribution guideline](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
All team members are also onboarded as the core members of *The Turing Way* project.
Please see [*The Turing Way* documents for core members](../the-turing-way-core) for details.
Also, see the [Ways of Working](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) in *The Turing Way*.

Members from collaborating projects can request to be added as a core member of *The Turing Way* upon approval from their line managers.
Please contact Malvika for details.

## Team Meetings

All members attend team meetings bi-weekly to discuss their projects, exchange ideas and deep dive into specific topics for community building, management and engagement.
Please read details in the [Team Meeting](./team-meetings.md) document.

## Commitments

All team members commit to
- abiding by the Code of Conduct and following the contribution guideline when participating in the Open Research Community Building team.
- participate in the team meetings by contributing to the meeting document, chairing a meeting, presenting reflections from their work and finding opportunities to collaborate.
- participate in *The Turing Way* project and events (such as Collaboration Cafe, Weekly Coworking Calls and Book Dash), whenever possible.
- making the implicit explicit by documenting their work as a community manager and researcher to share with other team members. 
  - Please add a link of your resource/document to the [resources for reference](./resources-for-reference.md) document, if openly shared. 
  - In case the project deals with sensitive and confidential data, please create a private repository to share information only with the people involved in the project. In addition, please create a public-facing document (such as a webpage, open repository) and/or a chapter in [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) to ensure open and reproducible practices are applied, promoted and shared without sharing confidential information.
- recording any new updates, exceptions or useful knowledge in project management and core documents needed to facilitate collaboration.
- dedicating their time and expertise to supporting other members and finding ways to build connections with others projects/work.
