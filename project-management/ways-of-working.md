# Ways of Working

This document provides the structure and organisation of the Open Research Community Management (RCM) Team, clarifying expectations and support structure enabling their work.

## Working Open

As members of the RCM Team, we are dedicated to working as openly as possible. 
We believe that our endeavours will be more successful through clear communication and collaboration than by keeping things closed. 
This document (and the entire repository) is designed to showcase our "work in progress". 
You're here to build accountability and help each other along the way!

We may have private repositories if our collaborators and collaborating projects have good reason to restrict information about some projects dealing with sensitive data, but we aspire to "be the change" and demonstrate open working practices wherever possible.

## Onboarding

If you're new to the team, please open the [Induction and Onboarding issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/community-manager-team/issues/new/choose) which will talk you through the different actions for your first days or week in the team.
Please make sure that you have been added to the Slack Workspace and given access to all shared resources (HackMD, Google Drive, GitHub) that the RCM team uses.

## Team Meetings

All members attend team meetings weekly to discuss their projects, exchange ideas and deep dive into specific topics for community building, management and engagement.
Please read the details in the [Team Meeting](./team-meetings.md) document.

## Reporting

- Malvika Sharan reports to Kirstie Whitaker.
- Research Community Managers report to Malvika Sharan (SRCMs), Emma Karoune (Health RCMs) and other TPS Senior Researchers based on the projects (DCE, TRIC:DT, AIM-RSF, Environment and Sustainability)
- Senior Research Community Managers join the RCM strategy meetings with Malvika and Kirstie Whitaker, TPS Director, to develop strategies such as for RCM processes, information sharing and skills development (through line management or informal mentoring) for the RCM team.
- Some members from collaborating projects may be invited to join the RCM team (such as from the Skills team), but they will report to their respective line managers. These members join the RCM team meetings biweekly.

## Working with *The Turing Way* 

*The Turing Way* ([the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome)) is a project for reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science.

Everyone interested in the project is welcome to use and contribute to the project as described in [*The Turing Way* contribution guideline](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
All team members are also onboarded to *The Turing Way* project as a contributor.

They will have an opportunity to support the Core Team of *The Turing Way*, details for which can be read in [*The Turing Way* documents for core members](../the-turing-way-core).

Also, see the [Ways of Working](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) in *The Turing Way*.

## Commitments

All team members commit to
- abiding by the Code of Conduct and following the contribution guidelines when participating in the Open Research Community Management team.
- participate in the team meetings by contributing to the meeting document, chairing a meeting, presenting reflections from their work and finding opportunities to collaborate.
- participate in *The Turing Way* project and events (such as Collaboration Cafe, Weekly Coworking Calls and Book Dash), whenever possible.
- making the implicit explicit by documenting their work as a community manager and researcher to share with other team members via *The Turing Way*. 
- Share resources/documents from their work openly through online repositories, websites or other creative ways. 
- In case the project deals with sensitive and confidential data, please create a private repository to share information with the people involved in the project. In addition, please create a public-facing document (such as a webpage, or open repository) and/or a chapter in [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way) to ensure open and reproducible practices are applied, promoted and shared without sharing confidential information.
- recording any new updates, exceptions or useful knowledge in project management and core documents needed to facilitate collaboration, such as this GitHub repository and the team report.
- dedicating their time and expertise to supporting other members and finding ways to build connections with others' projects/work.
