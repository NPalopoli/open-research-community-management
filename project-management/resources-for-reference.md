# Resources for Reference

The team will be exchanging resources from specific projects we work on.
You can highlight resources you use or learn from, materials you have generated within your projects or anything you believe others in the team might find interesting.
Though we will primarily focus on open research, community building and topics that are relevant for working in a participatory space, you can share other technical and practical resources that you have found useful in your work.

**Note**: There is an internal sheet to share materials with the team members that is updated regularly.
Any releavant information from the team meeting, team's communications and quarterly reports are added there.

We also have a [wiki page](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-community-building/wiki), which are used by some members - although not regularly maintained.
