    "text": "Welcome to the Research Community Managers Wiki\nCommunity Managers at the Turing invest in engaging, training and empowering a diverse group of researchers, research engineers, programme management, and business team members by fostering diverse communities of practice. They collaborate closely with others and identify where they can surface implicit knowledge and make information explicitly available so that everyone who wants to can participate. Through the active adoption of open research, reproducibility and collaborative approaches in data science projects, they contribute toward building interconnected systems of open source software, datasets, communities and processes.\nTogether as a team, we ensure that the research that happens at the Institute is created to be maintained, sustained, remixed and reused to make research and innovation more efficient and effective across the national and international data science ecosystem for commercial and public interest technologies alike."

    "text": "A code of conduct is a set of rules outlining the norms, roles, and responsibilities or proper practices of an individual party or an organization.\n\nThis Code of Conduct document outlines our expectations for participants within the team as well as this online repository (and the ideas, projects, and collaborations that might emerge from it). We also provide steps to reporting any concern, uncomfortable situation or unacceptable behaviour by other participants. We are committed to providing a welcoming, collaborative and inspiring experience for all members of this team and expect our code of conduct to be honoured.\n\n\nWe as members, contributors, and leaders are committed to making participation in our team a supportive and harassment-free experience for everyone. We commit to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy team, as well as the communities we facilitate. We encourage everyone in the team to participate in all team activities and work.\nWe are committed to facilitating Communities of Practice that are connected with each others’ work. Although we will fail at times, we seek to treat everyone both as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a member has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.\n\n\n\nAlthough this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honour diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with visible or invisible disabilities.\n\n\n\n\n4.1 Be friendly and patient.\n4.2 Be welcoming: we strive to build a welcoming and supportive team. As community facilitators, we also strive to apply this value in creating Communities of Practice that welcome and support members of all backgrounds and identities, while uphholding our commitment and diversity statement (see 2.).\n4.3 Be considerate: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re an open source project. This means that contributors might not be communicating in their primary language.\n4.4 Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a project where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.\n4.5 Be careful in the words that we choose: We are professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to Violent threats or language directed against another person, discriminatory jokes and language, posting sexually explicit or violent material, posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”), personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms, unwelcome sexual attention, advocating for or encouraging, any of the above behaviour, and repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.\n4.6 Try to understand why we disagree: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. We must resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. Diversity contributes to the strength of our work, which is composed of people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.\n\n\n\n\n5.1 Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:\n\nDemonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people\nBeing respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences\nGracefully giving and accepting constructive feedback\nAccepting responsibility for harm done to people and/or communities, correcting our mistakes, and learning from the experience to avoid future harm\nFocusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community in the long term\n\n5.2 Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:\n\nTrolling or insulting people in any interaction (online or in person)\nUsing aggressive, derogatory or derisive comments\nMaking personal or political attacks\nPublic or private harassment of any kind\nPublishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission\nInflicting emotional distress\nAny conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\nThe use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind\n\n\n\n\nWe want to establish a Code of Conduct that focuses on creating a welcoming and safe environment for everyone involved. If a participant does not abide by the Code of Conduct, we will use the “restorative practices” approach to handle the situation (see International Institute for Restorative Practices).\nRestorative practice has its roots in indigenous practices employed in cultures all over the world. This is a way of looking at wrongdoing that focuses on repairing the harm done to people and the relationships rather than on punishing offenders or wrongdoers. Restorative practices form the basis for “restorative justice,” a term coined in 1970 in the context of social work and justice systems.\nRestorative practices are based on the belief that human beings are happier, more cooperative and productive, and more likely to make positive changes in their behaviour when those in positions of authority do things with them, rather than to them or for them. The most critical function of restorative practices is restoring and building relationships. People in charge must meet with those they have wronged, explore what happened, and make necessary amends.\n\n\n\nFocuses on harms rather than the intention of wrongdoers.\nPrioritises persons affected and the consequent needs of victims and safety in communities.\nAddresses obligations of the wrongdoer resulting from those harms, as well as the team/community’s obligations to both victims and wrongdoers.\nCreates opportunity for all individuals in this team, who have a legitimate stake in a given situation, to be heard and their concerns addressed.\nSeeks to right the wrongs that have been done so that victims feel safe and valued, and wrongdoers feel restored to the team/community.\nUses inclusive, collaborative processes giving fair opportunity to right the wrongs.\n\n\n\n\n\nAcknowledges that trust, safe spaces and relationships are central to community building.\nMust establish policies and procedures that handle incident reports in a way that strengthens relationships.\nFocuses on harms done rather than rules broken.\nGives voice to the person who has been harmed.\nEngages in collaborative problem solving.\nEmpowers change and growth for all involved.\nEnhances responsibility for actions and attitudes of all involved.\n\nRestorative Practice Principles and Disciplines should guide the Open Research Community Building Team in creating a safe, friendly and enjoyable space for collaboration and support.\nWe will apply restorative practices in report handling and enforcement as described in 12.1.1 and 12.2.2.\n\n\n\n\nThe restorative practice statements and report handling process have been derived from the Eastern University Academic Charter School (EUACS) Student Code of Conduct derived from the work of Ted Wachtel at International Institute for Restorative Practices (IIRP) (download file).\nRestorative Practice Principles are based on Amstutz and Mullet (2005). Restorative Discipline for Schools, pp. 25-26. The Little Book of Restorative Discipline for Schools.\n\n\n\n7.1 This Code of Conduct applies to all team members participating in the activities, events and processes taking place within the Open Research Community Building Team. Specifically, our Code of Conduct applies to any conduct: - in interactions within the team/community - at any team activity, communication or event - outside the team activity when a team member is representing projects associated with the team\n7.2 This Code of Conduct also applies to individuals outside this team officially representing the community in public spaces.\nExamples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed a representative at an online or offline event.\n7.3 This Code of Conduct also applies to individuals engaging with this repository\nfor instance, in interactions on GitHub issues and Pull Requests or activities taking place in the context of the Open Research Community Building Team.\n7.4 Mediating interaction or communication between reporter and reportee is not in the scope of this Code of Conduct to maintain reproters’ confidentiality (see 10.3). The collaboration and dialogues based on restorative practices will take place between the reporter and the person handling the Code of Conduct, as well as between the reportee and the person handling the Code of Conduct separately.\n\n\n\nCommunity leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective, restorative and action in response to any behaviour that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.\n\n\n\nInstances of trolling, harassing, abusive, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour should be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement. If noticed by community leaders, incidents should be recorded and shared with one or more members of the Open Research Community Building Team for transparency.\nAll reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Together we strive to foster an environment where everyone feels valued, respected, and included.\n\n\n\n10.1 Code of Conduct Contact for Reporting\nIf you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the Team Lead, Malvika Sharan (email: msharan@turing.ac.uk). Malvika will involve the Senior Community Managers, Arron Lacey and Emma Karoune except when any potential conflict of interest with any of them may arise.\nTo report an issue involving the team lead, please email directly to Arron Lacey (email: alacey@turing.ac.uk) and/or Emma Karoune (email: ekaroune@turing.ac.uk).\nYou can directly contact the Tools, Practices and Systems Programme Director, Kirstie Whitaker. Since she is currently on maternity leave, please contact TPS Programme Manager Arielle Bennett (abennett@turing.ac.uk) - who is also our ombudsperson.\n10.2 In your report please include:\n\nYour contact information.\nNames (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please include a link.\nAny additional information that may be helpful.\n\n10.3 Confidentiality of Reporter(s)\nWe will respect the confidentiality of reporter(s) all the time to protect individuals who have been harmed. In case the reporter’s identity can not be hidden (if easily identified through the details of the report), the person handling the Code of Conduct report will discuss the possible ways to protect reporters from future incidents.\n\n\n\n\n11.1 Reporter: Person reporting an incident.\n11.2 Reportee: Person being reported.\n\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a report, the community leaders (or person handling the report), team lead or programme director, in this case, will review the incident report and follow this process to determine the cause and consequences that violated this Code of Conduct and take further actions:\n\n\nCommunity leaders will reach out to the reporter to ask for further information if the submitted report is not complete or needs some additional context. Community leaders will also ensure that person impacted or harmed by the reported incident is safe and identify how they can be further supported.\n12.1.1 A meeting with the reportee will be scheduled where the person handling the report will discuss these restorative questions: - What happened? - What were you thinking at the time? - Who has been affected by what you have done? In what way? - What do you think you need to do to make things right? - Knowing what you know, what would you have done differently?\n12.1.2 When the incident in question inflicted harm on another person, additional questions will be asked on behalf of the person(s) harmed: - What did you think when you realized what had happened? - What impact has this incident had on you and others? - What has been the hardest thing for you? - What do you think needs to happen to make things right?\nThe person handling the report may follow up with reportee or reporter after this discussion with any additional questions to help them reach a resolution. As per 7.4, mediating interaction or communication between reporter and reportee is not in the scope of this Code of Conduct.\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of Conduct should be considered as a norm-setting mechanism for the Open Research Community Building Team before any involvement of HR in the interactions that take place within the team.\nIf the reportee is a Turing employee, for instance, Community Managers and senior researchers and the incident is considered out of the scope of this Code of Conduct due to the severity of the matter/case, an HR process (formal or informal), will be started. In this case, the report will be passed to the HR and/or appropriate personnel under the Turing policies and the Turing’s CoC policy as well as enforcement mechanism will take precedent over this Code of Conduct enforcement.\nAll the Turing employees have the obligation to read and understand the HR/People policies, which include, but not limited to: - Workplace Guidelines - Code of Conduct Policy - Disciplinary Policy - Equality and diversity policy - Whistleblowing (Raising Concerns) Policy - Complaints policy - Bullying and harassment Policy - Research Misconduct Policy - Safeguarding policy - Grievance procedure - Wellbeing support services - Research Ethics Policy - Data protection policy - Conflict of Interest Policy\n\n\n\nAn appropriate (external) authority (such as the reportee’s employee or a law enforcement mechanism) will be identified who can respond to the reported incident with the appropriate action. The report will be passed to the external authority with an agreement to receive an update from their enforcement process.\nAn internal resolution will be agreed to provide support for the reporter and the person(s) harmed, as well as the continued participation of the reportee (see 13). The resolution or decision made by the external authority may or may not have an impact on the internal resolution. A transparency report will be shared with the members of the Open Research Community Building team.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are examples of possible resolutions to a report. This list is not comprehensive, and any action necessary to reach a fair resolution will be taken as needed. Possible resolutions to an incident include:\n\na private communication from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behaviour was inappropriate.\nan apology to the person harmed or the team/community as a whole - this will be done via the person handling the report.\nan action plan for the reportee to improve their awareness and correct future behaviours.\nreportee will have no unsolicited interaction with the reporter\nreportee will have no unsolicited interaction with reporter (in rare cases, when reporter is not anonymous) and those enforcing the Code of Conduct. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media.\nnot publishing the content (code, documents, media or other materials) that violated the Code of Conduct, until necessary changes have been made and agreed upon by the person handling the report.\nAn imposed suspension, such as asking reportee to “take a week or month off” from the GitHub repo or team activity.\nrecommended training activity relevant to correcting the behaviour or building awareness/understanding required to right the wrongs.\na stronger warning with consequences for continued behaviour.\nif a resolution is not reached, the ombudsperson will be consulted and any delay or status update for the Code of Conduct enforcement will be communicated with the reporter and reportee.\n\n13.1 After the Resolution is Agreed Upon\nOnce a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the person handling the report will contact the reporter and any other affected parties to explain the proposed resolution. They will ask if this resolution is acceptable and must note feedback for the record. However, they are not required to act on this feedback.\nThe reportee will be contacted via email informing them of the resolution. A final meeting may be conducted if necessary.\nThe person handling the report will maintain records of all reports so that they may be reviewed if stronger measures are required when repeated violations occur by the same individual as well as to improve our Code of Conduct for future participation.\n\n\n\nAll reports will be kept confidential with details shared only with people involved in report handling. If a person handling the report (team lead or programme director) is linked with the ongoing issue, they will declare their Conflict of Interest and remove themselves from any discussion related to the report handling. Resolution action may also include identifying appropriate members from within the Open Research Community Building Team if more support for the person handling the report is needed.\n\n\n\nThis code of conduct is drafted by Malvika Sharan, based on the Open Code of Conduct from the TODO Group, The Carpentries Code of Conduct and Contributor Covenant version 2.0. Community Impact Guidelines are inspired by Mozilla’s code of conduct enforcement ladder. All original work should be attributed to the respective authors of these documents.\nThe restorative practice statements and report handling process have been derived from the Eastern University Academic Charter School (EUACS) Student Code of Conduct derived from the work of Ted Wachtel at International Institute for Restorative Practices (IIRP) (download file).\nRestorative Practice Principles are based on Amstutz and Mullet (2005).

We believe that our endeavours will be more successful through clear communication and collaboration than by keeping secrets. This document (and the entire repository) is designed to showcase our “work in progress”. You’re welcome to help out along the way!\nWe may have private repositories if our collaborators and collaborating projects are more comfortable with restricted working on some projects, but we aspire to “be the change” and demonstrate open working practices wherever possible.\n\n\n\nIf you’re new to the team, please open the Induction and Onboarding issue which will talk you through the different actions for your first days or week in the team. Please make sure you have been added to the shared calendar for the community managers.\n\n\n\n\nCommunity Managers report to Malvika Sharan.\nSenior Community Managers report to Kirstie Whitaker, TPS Director.\nMalvika Sharan, along with other TPS senior researchers report directly to Kirstie Whitaker.\nMembers from collaborating projects report to their respective line managers.\n\n\n\n\nThe Turing Way (the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) is a handbook to reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science.\nEveryone interested in the project is welcome to use and contribute to the project as described in The Turing Way contribution guideline. All team members are also onboarded as the core members of The Turing Way project. Please see The Turing Way documents for core members for details. Also, see the Ways of Working in The Turing Way.\nMembers from collaborating projects can request to be added as a core member of The Turing Way upon approval from their line managers. Please contact Malvika for details.\n\n\n\nAll members attend team meetings weekly to discuss their projects, exchange ideas and deep dive into specific topics for community building, management and engagement. Please read details in the Team Meeting document.\n\n\n\nAll team members commit to - abiding by the Code of Conduct and following the contribution guideline when participating in the Open Research Community Building team. - participate in the team meetings by contributing to the meeting document, chairing a meeting, presenting reflections from their work and finding opportunities to collaborate. - participate in The Turing Way project and events (such as Collaboration Cafe, Weekly Coworking Calls and Book Dash), whenever possible. - making the implicit explicit by documenting their work as a community manager and researcher to share with other team members. - Please add a link of your resource/document to the resources for reference document, if openly shared. - In case the project deals with sensitive and confidential data, please create a private repository to share information only with the people involved in the project. In addition, please create a public-facing document (such as a webpage, open repository) and/or a chapter in The Turing Way to ensure open and reproducible practices are applied, promoted and shared without sharing confidential information. - recording any new updates, exceptions or useful knowledge in project management and core documents needed to facilitate collaboration. - dedicating their time and expertise to supporting other members and finding ways to build connections with others projects/work."

    "text": "As a team, we commit to collaborate, support and interconnect our projects with each other. As we continue to grow in our roles as community builders, technical skills, domain expertise and tips and tricks for working effectively in community and research spaces grows with it. Team meetings are a space for all members of the group to come together and learn from each other.\nTeam meetings are held every week. Members from collaborating project can choose to attend the meeting each week or biweekly, however they should maintain regular participation for consistency. Meetings will be conducted online and remote participation will be considered by default, but when possible and safe to travel, in-person meetings will be organised at The Alan Turing Institute. Our shared calendar will be updated with the times of the meetings, and when meetings are cancelled because they conflict with a relevant event that multiple team members may wish to attend.\nEvery team member is expected to participate in the team meetings. This doesn’t mean you have to attend every one, but it does mean that you are expected to complete the HackMD with your attendance or apologies, and to add something to share and a question to ask.\nThis document will talk you through the expectations for participation before, during and after team meeting. There is also a long motivation section about why we’ve designed the meetings this way.\n\n\n\n\nI ask for regular attendance from current team members. One hour meetings are not enough to effectively collaborate together. Especially when many of the projects the team works on require quite different domain expertise and respective teams. Please use team meetings as place to surface opportunities for collaboration and interconnections of your projects/work.\nImportantly, participation does not exclusively mean attending the meeting. Completing the HackMD in advance and sending apologies is sufficient to count as an active participant.\nTeam meeting will be chaired in rotation by different team members. Team meeting will only be cancelled if there is another event that multiple team members are encouraged to attend.\n\n\n\nIn advance of each week’s team meeting, the chair will send a notification with a link to a HackMD note.\nHackMD is a realtime, multi-platform collaborative markdown note editor. Everyone is able to edit the text in markdown when you click the the edit page, and HackMD renders the raw input as a nicely formatted website in the view rendering. You can see the raw markdown and the rendered page side by side by clicking the both button. You can read more about HackMD at https://hackmd.io/s/features.\nThe template for each team meeting is below, and you can read more about why we have this format in the motivation section at the end of this page.\nWhen you receive the HackMD link, please add your name under Attendees or Apologies. This lets the chair know that you’ve received the email and acknowledges that week’s meeting. It also means the chair knows who to wait for at the start of the meeting.\nIn advance of the meeting, please also complete the sections on Personal and project highlights (celebration, success, failures and everything in between), Community related things you are currently working on, What would you like team members’ opinion(s) on? Each point should be on a bullet pointed line with your name at the start of it (or you can use the HackMD magic of adding, for example, [name=Malvika] at the start of the line to make this look really pretty). For ideas about what to write (and most importantly, to make sure you know why we ask these questions) see the motivation section below.\nYou can put the 📢 emoji next to your bullet point if you would like that update to be shared publicly. You can leave comments, reactions, recommendations or feedback (when asked) or reply below what others have shared.\nPlease also read the Agenda section at the end of the HackMD for particular theme for the respective week’s discussion.\n# Open Research Community Building team Meeting | YYYY-MM-DD\n\n* Time: TBA\n* Zoom: TBA  \n\n[TOC]\n\n### Useful Notes and Links  \n\n* We will use Zoom for this call, unless stated otherwise\n* You can put the 📢 emoji next to your bullet point if you would like that update to be shared publicly.\n* You can leave comments, reactions, recommendations or feedback (when asked) or reply below ehat others have shared.\n* Please also read the **Agenda** section at the end of the HackMD for particular theme for the respective week's discussion.\n* Shared calendar with meeting times: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=cGtlazVnc2xkcjlwYWRhNjc4MTJyaGtiaW9AZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ\n* GitHub for the project repo: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/community-manager-team\n\n### Attendees  \n\n> *Please add your name below* \n* \n*  \n* \n* \n* \n* \n\n### Apologies\n* \n*   \n\n> *Please add your name below if you are not able to attend the meeting.*\n* \n*   \n* \n* \n* \n*   \n\n### Personal and project related highlights (celebration, success, failures and everything in between)\n\n> *Please add a bullet point with something you'd like the team members to know about.

Please arrive on time or let the session chair know if you will be delayed.\n\n\nThe chair will read through that week’s HackMD, starting with the topics you’ve shared and then covering the questions and points you’d like the group’s thoughts on. They will go quite fast through each of these points, but also encourage members of the team to expand on their updates and questions if they would like to.\nThis part of team meeting should take around 10-15 minutes. Everyone is encouraged to add links and resources as “sub-bullet points” (bullet points that are rendered as falling within the original point) before, during and after the meeting.\n\n\n\nThe meeting will have a specific theme, please suggest themes in the asks and offers document. After the chair has gone through the week’s HackMD notes, remaining time (approx 45 minutes) will be used for that discussion or presentation.\n\n\n\nIf the meeting is “open agenda” then the chair, in collaboration with all present team members, will select key points from the review of the bullet points in the HackMD to discuss in more depth for the remaining 45 minutes.\n\n\n\n\nAfter the team meeting, the chair is asked to provide a few sentences summarising the discussions and provide any useful resource to share on the project reporsitory in the resources for reference file. This is also an opportunity to update the Asks and Offers document for the future reference.\nRemember to include any points that have the loudspeaker emoji next to them. Use your best judgement when publicly sharing questions and comments that show particular vulnerability of the team members participating in the conversation.\nEveryone who participated in the meeting is encouraged to review the pull request, specifically when assigned/requested by the chair and approve before the next team meeting.\n\n\n\nEveryone is expected to chair team meeting on a rotating schedule.\nYour responsibilities as chair are to:\n\nCirculate the HackMD on the Monday before your team meeting.\nPlan an agenda for the meeting and check who will be speaking.\nFacilitate the conversation during the meeting. This includes making sure that everyone has a chance to participate, and that everyone complies with the code of conduct.\nWrite a summary and add it to resources for reference file as a Pull Request by the Monday after team meeting.\n\nThe prospect of chairing team meeting might feel really overwhelming! Being in charge of managing the time, coordinating everyone’s participation and facilitating a productive conversation is a lot of responsibility :grimacing: It is also a really important skill that will serve you well in future collaborations and as you advance through your career (inside of academia and beyond).\nThe first few times that you chair team meeting, please be in touch with Malvika, so she can answer any questions and mentor you though the experience.\n\n\n\n\nThis last section describes the structure of the team meeting drafted by Kirstie Whitaker, particularly focusing on the reasoning behind having the questions in each week’s HackMD note.\nIf you have any suggestions on additional points to cover or different phrasings, please let me know!\n\n\nThere is a great risk that the projects in the group are siloed and that your project lead or line manager becomes a bottle neck for communication. This is a centralised network (A in the diagram below). In contrast, a decentralised network (B) shares information more effectively. Small world networks in particular are efficient and resilient.\n\nDecentralization diagram uploaded to Wikimedia Commons by Adam Aladdin. Reused under a CC-BY license.\nI would like this team to be as decentralised as possible. I would like team members to find the answers to their questions quickly and receive help and support from all other team members in all dimensions.\nOne of the core goals of all team member is to improve collaboration (in academia and in the world!) And a core requirement of effective collaboration is trust. In fact, there was an article in the Harvard Business Review in 2011 that named trust as the “The One Thing That Makes collaboration Work”.\nBuilding trust is a difficult and multi-dimensional, but by being vulnerable with each other is one core component. In her book Emergent Strategy, and in this blog post from 2013, adrienne maree brown describes the following principles:\n\nlao tzu says “if you don’t trust the people, they become untrustworthy.” the first principle is a positive flip of this statement – if you trust the people, they become trustworthy. trust is a seed that grows with attention and space. the facilitator can be a gardener, or the sun, the water. there is a conversation in the room that wants and needs to be had. don’t force it, don’t deny it. let it come forth. the connection between the individuals is what makes the whole group/community strong.\n\n(Note that brown self determines what she capitalises, which reminds me of - and is possibly inspired by - black feminist writer bell hooks who did not capitalise her name in order “to focus on the substance of her work, not who [she] is”.)\nIf we want information to flow around a decentralised network, then we need to trust each other. I believe that building connections between individual people are the magic that will lead to the most exciting and innovative data science.\n\n\n\n\nPersonal and project related highlights (celebration, success, failures and everything in between).\n\nIf five people come to team meeting, every week for four weeks, and each time they share something interesting, we’ll curate 20 content recommendations in just one month. I’m willing to bet that at least 1 in those 20 will be useful for the team. So the first reason to ask people to share some information is to do exactly that: share knowledge.\nPeople are often uncomfortable celebrating their successes. And that is a limitation on the goal of sharing knowledge. Both imposter syndrome and the Dunning–Kruger effect can stop people from sharing skills and resources that they know. They may not recognise their strengths, or know how much they don’t know and therefore keep quite while others speak much more. The second goal of sharing something every week is to have team members build confidence in their expertise. Everyone has something to contribute.\nAnd finally, it feels really good to celebrate others’ achievements! Leaving a little :sparkling_heart:, :raised_hands: or :rocket: emoji, or maybe even a few words of congratulations makes you feel good. This third goals is to help us all see the progress along a career that is generally rewarded at the end of very long term timescales (a paper takes years to write, and a thesis even more so). Stopping once per week to recognise what we’ve all achieved will help us all along the long research road.\n\n\n\n\nWhat would you like team members’ opinion(s) on?\n\nAsking questions is the first step in finding the answers. If team members do not ask for help in the first place, then the communities will not be able to support them. One goal of this section in the team meeting HackMD is to unblock team members so they can move forwards on with their work.\nResponses to a question might be:\n\nTo share a piece of code so they don’t need to write it again.\nTo share a relevant publication or blog post.\nTo share a tutorial that explains how to use a software tool.\nTo put the team member in touch with an expert in the field they’re investigating.\nTo share a similar experience and what went right (or wrong) that time.\n\nAsking questions is also a learned skill. Analogous to a Minimal worked example it takes time and practice to distill your question from “It doesn’t work” or “I don’t know what to do” to a specific “I get this error message when I run this command”, “I’m stuck on interpreting this figure”, “How do I manage this particular challenging community interaction”, or “Where should I store my data”. In many cases, it is in creating the question in the first place that you figure out what you need to know.\nSo the secondary goal of this section is to help you ask good questions.\nThis illustration from her blog post on “How To Ask Good Questions” by Julia Evans is wonderful. (The blog post is great too!) Just don’t let it trick you into thinking that the only good questions are related to technical expertise. The hardest and most important questions are about how we plan and design, undertake, and communicate our research rather than “just” the software tools and datasets they contain.\n\nHow to ask good questions by Julia Evans\n\n\n\nMany of the projects that each member is involved in are distributed around the world. Many of us are not co-located and so it is important to find ways to share expertise and build connections and trust from afar.\nThe HackMD and Zoom links allows team members to contribute without being physically in the room.\nThe HackMD also allows team members to contribute even if they are not able to join the meeting. That way, we can hear updates from them and get answers to our questions, even if our collaborators are not able to join the conversation in real time.\nFinally, the HackMD lets everyone talk at once. You can find links and add comments as the conversation in the room is ongoing, which allows parallel participation rather than waiting to speak in a serial timeline.\n\n\n\n\nI really appreciate your participation in the team. We couldn’t do the exciting work without you.\nThis document is developed reusing documents from “Whitaker Lab Project Management” by Dr Kirstie Whitaker and the Whitaker Lab team, used under CC BY 4.0."

Well done to you both!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCM on prep for AB meeting\n\nKW: Ah GREAT!\n\nFM on co-orindation with PPIE workstream\n\nKW: ALSO GREAT! 🙏\n\nLF and RE on AB doc amendments.\n\nKW: 🌠\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAB presentation\nEDoN lab presentation\n\nKW: Thank you for presenting!!\n\nFirst Turing Way Cafe\n\nKW: ☕☕☕\n\nDiscovered and tested GitLens plugin for VSCode!\n\nKW: NICE!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing too much this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nVariational Recurrent Autoencoders\nThink about collecting analysis approaches for the Hub (where? format? repro MWE?)\n\nKW: I think this is a great idea - a resource that can serve as inspiration for research questions\n\n“A bottom up approach to setting the scientific questions” - what can be done, what has been done in related fields etc.\n\nI think if we can make this interoperable with the PID that would be really helpful.\n\nSome sort of template of what information should be included - citations that have done something similar, sample code, types of data that would be fed in?\n\nGitLab (private) repository for the “bag of models” 👜\n\nEDoN Ethics Form\n\nKW: That’s great - really easy to build on from the scientific questions discussion and the advisory board document.\n\nInterviews for AIM Community Manager\n\nKW: Thank you for changing working days around\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf Ethics Form gets done this week then KW to review\n\nKW: :100:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot this week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProductive week, not hampered by COVID 💪\n\nKW: So glad you’re feeling ok!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPIE becoming a good focus - all hubs can work really well together\n\nKW: LOVE THIS\n\nOK’d to look at supervised analysis\n\nKW: Also great\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFM with the Newsletter\n\nKW: 🙏 Awesome!!\nWork with PIE and SRE 🚀\n\nPIE group to start thinking about a steering committee\n\nKW: LOVE THIS - Please can you let DC & EB know so the AIM RSF work in this space is aligned\n\nSG testing PR test-autocompress-image\n\nKW: 🙌 Super helpful\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD and KW with Advisory Board doc\n\nKW: Looking SO GOOD - thank you!\n\nAR with tips for my first co-working session\n\nKW: YAAY!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvisory Board doc submitted\n\nKW: 🙌 GREAT JOB!\n\nTwo items on EDoN Newsletter\n\nKW: Also really great - thank you!\n\nHelped with Analytics Hub 2022 plan\n\nKW: Yes! I’m feeling more hopeful here\n\nTested docker rootless - going into Turing Way\n\nKW: Oooooooh - 🤯 - how cool is THAT?!\nREALLY keen for you to explore that with some of the secure research environment admins??\nLet me know when you have a chapter update that could be shared for their feedback.\n\nRead around student’s topic on Enrichment Scheme\n\nKW: AAAAAH THANK YOU for doing this!! 🙏\nI’m so glad that you were able to give them some feedback\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRan out of puff with Advisory Board doc towards the end…\n\nKW: Feel you on this - but it looked fantastic!! Well done.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGet ball rolling on Ethics Doc in colab with PIE group\nInclude supervised classification methods in analysis plan\n\nCan we answer “how long until I decline into dementia?” with supervised techniques?\nThe GLMVQ paper projects trajectories of ADNI-MEM score vs distance to mean profile of MCI\nDoesn’t project using time\nRE mentioned SVM hinge-loss - will be similar to above^\n\nPick back up on Stochatic Differential Equations with stan\nHopefully meeting with DD and Turing REG on SRE T2\nModify and PR to https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/book/website/reproducible-research/renv/renv-containers.md\n\nKW: The plans look great - thank you!\n\n\n\n\nEthics draft from KW\n\nKW: Send the template docs… should have some time next week to start brainstorming the content with you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot this week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack from annual leave!\n\n\n\n\n\nWe now have a draft 2022 plan for the hub. Need to review and add actions.\n\nKW: I’m hopeful the co-working session tomorrow can get us to the end of this doc 🤞\n\nWe have the advisory board meeting on the 14th Feb. Lisa needs materials mid-next week.\n\nKW: 🙀\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNA (annual leave)\n\n\n\n\n\nKW has kept me in the loop!\n\n\n\n\n\nNA (annual leave)\n\n\n\n\n\nLifting heavy furniture!\n\nKW: 😅 💪\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed to get AB meeting materials circulated to Analytics Hub by end of this week. Can draw attention to this at Hub meeting on Friday\nFind out how we can help the PPIE group.\n\nKW: One angle is the ethics application\n\nStakeholder mapping, and stakeholder engagement - who are they planning to engage with? Whose voices will be represented?\nLooking forwards: how do “we” (Analytics Hub) stay in touch with the patience & members of the public?\n\nHow often connect? In what form?\n\nOn the current ethics form we ask about the “societal benefits and harms” and it would be great if they were patient led rather than analyst / clinican defined.\n\nKW: Another angle is openness and reproducibility - we’re going to need to communicate why we’re using lots of data from lots of sources.\n\nWould be really helpful if members of the public cared about generalisability - having data from various backgrounds.\nMight need to set up explainers for open research components (open source, metadata vs managed access to data etc)\n\nKW: I’d also be really keen for you to take forward the 2x2 risk matrix with members of the public!!!\n\nWhat happens if the ML doesn’t add anything? How weak a signal is too weak to continue?!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I get initial draft of AB docs by Thursday if KW could have a quick glance before going to Analytics Hub.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot this week - focussed 🎧\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting back into a rythm now the kids are back in school.\nKW: And enjoy annual leave! 🏡\n\n\n\n\n\nGot an analysis plan sent out to RE and hope he can provide feedback or agree to distribute to wider analytics hub. Not heard anything back yet but we are trying to have an internal hub meeting this week.\n\nKW: Thank you for talking me through the analysis plan!\n\nWe have two deliverables due by the 7th Feb (one just before the 7th) - the advisory board meeting and EDoN Hub Analysis Plan 2022\n\nKW: 🙀 Good to know - I checked with AM and they’re on her radar too…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have tried to help the Analytics Hub this week to prepare for our two deliverables. Split up tasks for the board meeting and working with DD on bringing it together.\n\nKW: So glad you’re here! Thank you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDD has provided a Data Management Plan outline that he has been working on and will be used as materials for the Advisory Board to give feedback on.\n\nKW: Team work 🙌\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown file detailing Latent Class Mixture Models (LCMM) for trajectory Analysis in R - build off some ideas Richard has previously proposed.\n\nKW: Mega helpful ✔️\n\nGot ball rolling on Advisory Board meeting and Analystics 2022 plan\n\nKW: Great\n\nWorking on a Stocastic Differential Equation (SDE) as an alternative plan - has potential to be more flexible than LCMM\n\nKW: Super interesting\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNothing too much this time. Next week will need some good collaboration between the Hub so hopefully that goes ok.\n\nKW: Yeaaaaaaah - good heads up for me to be focused next week 👀\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWrite up material for the following two points for AB meeting\n\nThe expertise/advice the Turing brings to EDoN regarding open research and accessibility\n\nKW: This one is kinda interesting - I think Turing Way is important here, but also probably the work on safe and ethical AI (PPP and S&EAI programme)\nI think NG could almost certainly help here - probably don’t need to write anything completely from scratch.\n\nThe impact of open/transparent/ethical approaches on the research and deployment phases of EDoN\n\nKW: I think there SHOULD be some good stuff in The Turing Way to cite for this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will ask the Whitaker Lab team for the most important point that comes to mind for them for both of the bullet points above. Optional input of course!\n\nKW: Super interesting question to brainstorm!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorking at Tier 3 SRE - maybe it’s all covered but a new pair of eyes can help to brainstorm how we do things.\n\nKW: Discussed in the meeting - I think we’re going to need to keep anonmyisation (Tier 3) and analyses (Tier 2) completely separate, from a process / safety perspective.\n\nAfter we have our Hub deliverables completed I will work with Turing REG and DD on getting Tier 2 github and wiki set up.\n\nKW: This looks great ✔️\n\n\nCC BY 4.0 License, reused from the Whitaker Lab Project Management Repository"

I’ve sent some details on specific work tasks DC’s way and offered help for whenever it’s needed. PPIE lead is still away, but DC and EB have indicated that they don’t have specific asks yet. * External AIM-RSF website is almost up and running (have been making content changes based off suggestions from a Monday afternoon meeting) and is a priority for this week ahead of events coming up.\nPPIE & Constortia Meetings\n* Have been meeting with PPIE leads 1:1 and starting having larger meetings with Consortia leads (with DC & MF) that have provided so much insight!! This has been 2 weeks in the works getting set up.\nGitHub & Community Building work * Have been supporting EZ with collating GitHub training materials while also doing bitty tasks with the repositories (CoC’s, Project boards, GitHub Actions, Issues, Onboarding, reviewing PR’s etc). * ⚠️ Ran into a major blocker that EB has flagged around IT, GitHub, and Slack. As of today, we are continuing ahead as it’s for the higher ups to figure out.\n* 🤦 Had issues with cross-consortia comms, email invites, and meeting links so no one showed up to Evelina’s talk. We’ve set out a bit of a plan for how to approach this in the future. * EK - thanks for flagging these issues.\n\n\n\n\nRun through the updates.\nThe upcoming changes to Slack & GitHub Collaboration.\nChannels of communication that your projects have used successfully.\n\n\n\n\nSupported a cross-consortia meeting and took notes with EZ & MM for DC.\nConnected MM to TTW Community and curated resources/had a discussion about attributions and authorship.\nDC with creating his first GitHUb repository.\nEG & EZ with setting up the Hugo site.\nAS/TTW with reviewing the June newsletter.\n\n\n\n\n\nEK with the template ethics form, ✍️ and others with confirmation of what forms to use and where to find guidance.\nEB with a super insightful meeting on the RoPA forms and GDPR.\nEZ and MM with collaborative notes (we stayed far after the end of the work day trying to understand them)\nDC & MF with taking the lead during meetings and being fantastic folks to work with (& learn from).\nMarkus & others in REG (ask away channel) debugging some homebrew issues (and shout out to JD for some preliminary discussion).\nDC & EB with outstanding awesomeness (they’re just great folk to work with and make things easy).\n\n\n\n\n\nEthics forms were figured out (thanks to EK & others). The blank template has been uploaded into the GitHub repo.\nGot the probation statements in Cezanne and signed off 🎉\nFinished the recent batch of HR forms.\n\nMet with 3 PPIE leads across various projects.\nMet with EZ and planned application for OLS (meeting notes here).\nCollated some resources for EZ on TTW’s GitHub introduction and workshops and started creating a presentation tailored to the consortium members.\nI’ve been exploring WelcomeBots and what’s best to set up for the AIM-RSF community.\nI’ve been on calls with various folks exploring various features on GitHub (Projects, Issues, Discussions, and GitHub Actions to link them all together) and getting them quickly onboarded into the project work that is immediately due.\nUploaded a starter Glossary of Terms to the GitHub repository and opened a discussion with Eirini (and others) to have around making the list easy to use.\n\nEK - All great work - very happy that you and EZ are applying to OLS6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverwhlem Feeling a smidge overwhelmed as some tasks are taking longer than expected this past week. Trying to keep working hours is proving a bit hard as I feel guilty about not getting things done in the expected timeframe (i.e. noticed lots of typos in the ethics form and some of the questions were different than the TREx approach so it’s still an open task).\nKeeping track of tasks. I need to rebuild up some form of task tracking system as I’m getting pings for small requests that I can do, but forget what they’re related to and need to move on to the next thing.\nSummary Email/Notes I fell out of habit writing end of day summaries last week so had a monster job on friday pulling it all together into an email and sending it out (was favouring getting to bed early as I’m up early on some calls with California last week and this). I’ve picked the daily logs back up this week but not having sent out that email (and even just curating it for myself) have left a massive gap in internal comms.\n\nEK - you are doing great so try not to feel overwhelmed - you are progressing on tasks so making progress. Project boards sounds like a good future plan for task tracking. Summary notes - they are hard to maintain so maybe doing this verbally or putting your personal summaries in a doc on github so you don’t have to clean up?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthics submission (the commitee meet generally 2 x month - or at least they’re supposed to) so I’ve just missed themost recent one and will shoot for the July meeting.\nMeetings with the consortia.\nEvents website.\nOLS Application.\nExternal communication about the PPIE and ECR sessions (planned for July 6th).\nSummary notes (back in the habit).\n\n\n\n\n\nWould love if I could offload the Code of Conduct and GitHub documentation tasks (possibly to EZ).\n\nEK - let’s try to have a discussion with EZ about tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAny suggestions for how I can better support EZ?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLC is away for the next few weeks and the NIHR report deadline is coming up so I’m stepping up with DC to fill in some PPIE gaps, the Drugs Coding work is getting set up quick as the wave 1 funding is wrapping up soon so quite a few projects have deadlines to meet.\nThe new Data Wrangler is getting a lot put on their plate, and EZ has some space to wrap their head around things.\nI haven’t heard much about the stakeholder mapping task and Mural is blocked so it seems like Excel might be a good place for things at this point in time.\nThe TREx ethics forms may not have been the correct ones to fill out based on the current handover for TREx - Tony and Vanessa have been emailed to get more clarity on this.\nDC is starting to set up conections with the consortia PMs so I can reach out about PPIE workstreams.\n\nEK - let’s bring the Mural issue to the Whitaker lab meeting this week as it seems to be becoming more of a problem.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProbation statements\n\nEK - we have discussed this and SB to submit this week.\n\nWorkload (taking things in moderation)\n\nEK - you already have a lot of tasks so please concentrate on those ones and don’t take anymore unless it is urgent.\n\n\n\n\n\nEZ & MM with onboarding their first week\nMM with general task support when she had questions\nLC with some strategy for getting in touch with the PPIE consortia leads.\n\n\n\n\n\nHR with chair and general support.\nEG with some great input on docs\nDC with reviewing and giving input into some PR’s and other docs\nAS, HS, & EP with the CarpentriesCon submission\nEK with the connection to SSI fellow\n\n\n\n\n\n✅ Ethics proposal draft completed (only for it to be the TREx one, and not the current form - GA & I have reached out to Vanessa, Tony and Victoria for clarity after talking to Chris)\n✅ CarpentriesCon proposal submitted with AS, HS, & EP.\n✅ Drafted probation statements\n✅ Onboarding sessions were awesome 🎉\n✅ Presented in the Community Management meeting\n✅ Met with a project lead about PPIE\n✅ Set up some repositories and assigned teams\n✅ Connected with SSI fellow at UCL about drugs coding\n✅ Continued mapping engagement metrics from the consortia meetings\n✅ Connected with external group (Richmond Charities) who run PPIE workstreams\nEK - This is all great! 🌟 and thanks for being the main onboarder of the new starters 🙌\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling like I need to dial back the workload a touch this week and focus on only a few big tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFiguring out what ethics forms actually need to be submitted (and to who - the link on Topdesk returns a Page not Found)\nSupporting GitHub training materials being collated\nSupporting DC with the NIHR report (PPIE lead is away on leave)\nExternal AIM-RSF website\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport moderating what I should/can take on.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis space is yours to add to as needed.\nIs there any particular reading/topic/task we want to explore and bring to our next meetings?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Examples: recognitions (recognize colleagues), sparkling moments (recognize community members), shout-outs) Been a busy week, but I’m super ✨ about the work that’s got done and the direction things are heading. DC is an absolute rockstar and I’m really excited to meet our new team members!\n\n\n\nFeeling a bit stuck in places due to not having a clear picture of what’s going on inside the consortia. We need to get an information processing piece in place, and after that’s confirmed then I might be able to start reaching out to folk and having coffee chats to get an idea of what’s going on. So I’m feeling a bit stuck unable to identify the known unknowns, and daunted but unknown unknowns. * EK - get yourself invited to project meetings so that you can be that lurker - listen for people of interest and also tasks you can intervene.\n\n\n\n\nApproaching AutSPACEs workblocks\n\nEK - planning of what task need doing, time they will take and deadlines for doing each - work out with GA.

Good vibes all around. * EK - I am getting great feedback on how you are doing so a big well done!\n\n\n\nGot a lot of clarity around work remit, project scope, and work tasks in the past week which is great! The citizen science platform is a big part of work that is a priority for the project. It will require focus groups first and appropriate scoping, but it is a big piece that we’re moving forward with. There’s a lot of work coming down the pipeline now and I have a better understanding of how to prioritise tasks aligned with the bigger picture. * EK - this is great for getting clarity on tasks.\n\n\n\n\nRun through updates, larger discussion on the “help” task\n\nAm unsure how to balance “I can support or take on a task” with the worry that I’m taking work off people. I feel like I can keep myself busy but also have tasks flagged as key that I don’t know how to/if I should take over.\nEK - I have met with DC and MS about producing a minimum set of task for you and then some ‘what would be nice’ add ons. DC should get this to us this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nEG with running the ECR session\nDC with some github workflows\nGA & AutSPACEs team with some strategy work\nAutSPACEs community with some work tasks and creating presentations\nGA with some conference talk planning\nDC & EB with some Zoom meeting management\n👫 with some life balancing\nEK - great work! 🙌\n\n\n\n\n\nGA with getting a draft presentation outlined\nCB with some ethics resources\nBGT with some steering about work when he joins\nDC with awesome support\nEK with some github file management suggestions\nEK - keep reaching out for help as collaboration is our thing 😉\n\n\n\n\n\n✅ Hosted the ECR lunchtime session (and have added notes to GitHub, see PR here)\n✅ Chatted with Chris Burr and began outlining ethics submission for focus group\n✅ Had awesome AutSPACEs strategy meeting\n✅🎉 Met with Lynsey Cross about PPIE work scope and priorities (and got awesome clarity about priorities!)\n✅ Started scoping out GitHub options in preparation for meeting\n✅ Planned and drafted presentation for Austistica festival (Due: 30 May)\nEK - wonderful work Sophia 🤩\n\n\n\n\n\n⚡‼️💥\n\n\n\n\n\nFinish presentation for Autistica Festival\nRecord presentation for Autistica Festival\n60% first draft of ethics form for TREx\nGitHub meeting (outcomes & decision factors documented)\nMeet with PPIE & Legacy leads (Lynsey Cross and Mon Fletcher) to sync up about work being done\nReach out to NIHR PPIE folk (People in Research) via email to open a line of dialogue\nPlan for small presentation week of the 6th about work plan and task scope\n\n\n\n\n\nSoundboarding & sense check on work environments/remit. Aka. Should I start chipping away at the Citizen Science in a box work and shift the other tasks?\n\nEK - we chatted about this and DC will provide a list of task for you to focus on - hopefully this will give you a clear stir of where to invest your time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDC (and EB with all the set up!!) has been an absolute star. I’ve been seeing the amount of invisible work that he does and it’s brill ⚡\n\n\n\n\nHave found (almost) all the docs! It was a massive unblocking to get access to things and read through them to understand the project and how I’m meant to fit in.\nAm still finding my feet understanding what my role is within the bigger picture - but I know this will become clear with time (and once I’ve met with LC)\n\nEK - Good progress getting access to all docs. 🌟\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEG, DC, and others by stepping up to run the ECR lunchtime session this week.\nGA with some strategy scoping on AutSPACEs.\n👫 when they became unwell.\n🐐 duties and lab checkins.\nEK - great work.\n\n\n\n\n\nVH with understanding the community manager role and how they navigated it.\nEG with understanding more about the goals of the ECR engagement.\nJD with a remote call (was going to be in person) understanding their work and brainstormed ideas.\nDC with some great support, giving feedback, and working hard to get me up to speed.\nEK - keep asking for help where you need it. Wonderful that you have DC and EG for support.\n\n\n\n\n\nthese are easy wins as they’re ‘learning’ and ‘get to know folk’ focused.\n\nBig Win: 🌟 I made a flyer (that I was quite proud of) and drafted up information about the ECR lunch session to be sent out. * EK - the flyer looks fab.\nCommunity Management: * ✅ Have got access to the GitHub Repo and Sharepoint and am familair with the contents * ✅ found an area of the NIHR AIM site which has docs on PPIE here * ✅ Gained better understanding of the challenges some groups are facing in terms of data access and sharing of methods. * ✅ Attended first RSF seminar * ✅ Attended first RSF Ops meeting (and made a few suggestions) * ✅ Reached out to events team to understand what their role is and how my role and theirs can work together * ✅ Read through Sharepoint files and got up to speed some more\nPPIE/Focus Groups: * ✅ Read through the TREx forms and have started scoping what sort of questions the focus groups are needed for. * ✅ Had meeting wih Georgia to learn about how AutSPACEs approached focus groups.\nGeneral Learning: * ✅ Attended seminar from MSF Scientific Days International on community involvement in their organisation’s projects.\n\n\n\n\nI felt blocked on tasks and weren’t able to remove the blockers myself.\nFeeling guilty for not doing more work for the SSI speed blogging group.\n\n\n\n\nUrgent & Important: 1. Prepping for and running the ECR lunchtime session (3hrs) 2. Preparing materials for the brainstorm meeting on migrating docs to GitHub (5 hours, open ended)\nUrgent: 3. AutSPACEs conference talk (8-10 hours - of this week). Deadline May 30th to have it filmed and submitted.\nImportant: 4. Draft of TREx Ethics Submission (3 work days)\n\nEK - Looking great - but let’s talk more about task prioritising next week.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding more about how different groups use GitHub (emphasis on understanding the logic, the approach, and the organizational structure)\n\nEK - I gave a tour of the Decovid repository and we talked about how it is used and approach taken in that project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre there any books, blogs, or short coffee readings about community management, health data etc that you would reccomend.\n\nEK - I will have a think about this more but of the top of my head - I like CSCCE blogs and resources\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAB was a massive help double checking some admin & reimbursement forms I was unsure about AND had a great coffee last week getting me up to speed\nEG was super awesome getting me up to speed with the RSF\nAwesome onboarding session with MS, DC, & EB\nSuper grateful for folks from the Public Policy team who took me to lunch on Friday\n\nEK - great that you have connected with so many people already. 🌟\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent tasks are about getting up to speed with where things are at with the RSF, and what sort of work do I need to muck in on short term.\n\nThere seems to be a good opportunity to lead with some Turing Way workflows in how notes and the like are stored & shared. Will need to have a few scoping conversations to figure out what the best way forward will be.\n\nEK - let’s chat about DECOVID repo when you start working no your repository.\n\nThis presents a small challenge as putting a line in the sand and forcing everything into markdown and github may not meet the community where they are and so deep thinking is needed.\n\n\nWorked to integrate reviewer feedback for a conference submission on AutSPACEs with GA. Am exploring/figuring out what the split between AutSPACEs and AIM will be.\n\nEK - This is great!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling like I’m not necessarily doing “tasks” at the moment. Am just unsure of if I should be working harder and mucking in more: and am finding the balance difficult between the phd mindset vs working life mindset where it’s okay to not solve all the world’s problems in a day.\n\nEK - start a few of the tasks from your list sent last friday such as community mapping and glossary - drawing info together that you have and then asking for input.\n\n\n\n\n\nGA with integrating reviewer feedback\nDC & EB with brainstorming some operational steps for AIM that support an open workflow\n\nEK - great work!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone!\n\nOnboarding: MS (with the awesome checklist), EK, EB & DC, EG, AB\nFeeling welcome: everyone as listed above and also JD, AC, VH, + Turing office folk\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConnected with RSF collaborators CN and MF via email\nSet up coffee call with CN (collaborator) (DC suggested we get in touch)\nWorked on a revision request for a conference workshop for AutSPACEs\nConnected with DC around RSF strategy and working openly\nFinished reading through RSF github repo\nFinished HR onboarding & Cyber Security training\nStarted working on reimbursement forms\nOnboarded into cm-team with MS\nMet with 4 of Turing’s leads on the AIM RSF and synthesized an overview of the project & my role\n\n⚠️ would appreciate guidance on where the from the email notes can be stored\n\nCollated preliminary scope of my responsibilities\n\n\n\n\n\nCovid delays have made it difficult to meet with specific PPIE folk\n\nEK - Just keep asking when you can connect.\n\n\nGeneral feelings of “should I be doing something more useful with my time”\n\nEK - you have already done so much! Keep going to meetings, listening and meeting more people - this is the unseen work of community managers.\n\nAlso need to keep an eye on how I’m structuring my days as I’m starting early and finishing late and have been excited and caught up in tasks so haven’t taken clever breaks. It was the first week though, so it’s a self-check more than anything else.\n\nEK - Something to keep an eye on - you will find a good routine once you are fully settled in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue reading through the resources shared by Dave and Elizabeth, & what is on the GitHub repo.\nOrganise a meeting with LC and other PPIE folk to understand the PPIE work that is being done.\nAttend all AIM RSF meetings and get a deeper understanding of how my work fits in\nBubble away at ethics approval, glossary, community mapping and open workflow.\n\n\n\n\n\nBrainstorming where to start on ‘creating an open workflow that embodies TPS principles into AIM RSF’. Don’t need an instant solution, more so an experienced sounding board to help formalize ideas and think up the right questions to ask.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ve mentioned that you maintain a repo that is mainly used by you (and not collaborators). Can I ask why others don’t use it? (I’m trying to scope out how open consortia folks will be to github workflows).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Examples: recognitions (recognize colleagues), sparkling moments (recognize community members), shout-outs)\n\n\n\nReview your current projects, relation and skill-building that you are working on.

And start standardising this process so it is easy to send emails from templates, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave enquired about a synthetic data speaker but no response yet so will need to change\n\nEK - there are folks at the turing that do this.

In all these, please find opportunities to advocate for your community to enable research and collaboration. Project management and what was agreed on contracts are important to consider, but this partnership has a CM position so that we can enable chanced interactions and collaborations through community building with different members at the Turing and Roche - NOT just with those who are already involved.\n\n\n\n\n\nSame as last week ha…. get the seminar series comms out and finally put some docs on GitHub!\nAlso working on roadmap with MOG and HM tomorrow\nMS: Exciting!

Feel like some of the pieces of the partnership are starting to come together more and was nice to find a link into the Turing Way via the Code Review group, especially after discussions at last week’s lab meeting. - MS: Super delighted to see this coming together.\n\n\n\nFunding call and senior research associate advert closing is a reminder that we the community of the partnership will be growing very soon. Reflecting on what I need to prepare to ensue onboarding is as soon as necessary. Also expert panel meeting went well, am keen to captialise and plan for the next meetings. - MS: Impact, purpose and connections between expert panels will be helpful in designing your sesssions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelped AM with interviewing 3 candidates for RPM role\nReviewed peer review chapter in TTW for LK\nHelped answer application queries for SM funding call\n\nMS: Great job handling the funding cals.

We can try to set a miro board for this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFound it difficult to put together documentation from scratch- definitely find it easier to work collaboratively with someone on this.\n\nMS: Same! Maybe ask in the cm team channel for help? But glad that it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinalise comms and github document\nMake a start on stakeholder mapping\nChase up RM on GE piece\n\nMS: Excited to work on this with you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of the funding applications have mentioned Github for sharing their code/data. HM mentioned I’ll need to set this up so will likely need support here.\nAny feedback on comms/github docs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeeling good to be on the same page as MOG and HM this week- definite push for us to start putting together roadmap type docs with the scientific leads of the partnership so we can plan for the year. - That would be really helpful in getting some timeline added to leads’ calendar. All the best!\n\n\n\nStarted off feeling on top of things this week and now slightly less! Putting together the expert panel agenda has made it clear that we’re not quite aligned as a group with what we want out of the panel so need to work through this. - Have experts been consulted for their interest in what they want to bring to the panel?\n\n\n\n\n\nHelped the research leads with a letter to the editor they want to submit for a potential journal submission, helped HM with some funding call queries. - 🙌\n\n\n\n\nAR helped me with what I needed to do for goatherding.\nYou did a pretty solid goadtherding. I need to keep up with that next week :D\nHM helped me think about what other documents I need to put together for the partnership such as a comms plan.\nComm strategy doc will definitely be useful especially to align what is announced by you and what needs to be aligned with the Turing comms team. I would love to see how this develops and if I can help with that. I suggest adding some internal engagement aspect in there too.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave put together a presentation on slack for community management for this week’s lab meeting\nAmazing! Do upload them on Zenodo if you feel that could be generally useful. You can cite that in a chapter that you are planning to write for the TTW.\nHave started the expert panel agenda- needs sending out asap\nTeam charter should be finalised-ish by Friday\nThis is amazing! Looking forward to reading that.\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert panel agenda- need consensus by the end of the week!]\nKeeping my fingers crossed. Looks like this is a lot of back and forth planning.\n\n\n\n\n\nExpert panel meeting is on Monday. Once thats out the way, hoping to have time to start other documents- potentially a comms plan, stakeholder mapping.\nAlso need to think about how to keep workshop community engaged, have dropped off a bit\nHappy to cowork on some of these with you and see where we can align you work with TPS.\n\n\n\n\n\nHave a meeting with EK next week on community Githubs and will also pick her brain on comms stuff as suggested by HM\nPerhaps some advice on how to keep workshop community engaged- am struggling for ideas at the moment\nLet’s chat about it in our 1:1\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed to move next week’s catchup!

So amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\nHelped expert panel with their COI forms and getting them added to the Turing site so they’re represented on the Turing-Roche webpage. - MS: It’s been a quiet week! The expert panel seems like a proactive and interesting bunch of people.\n\n\n\nComms/CRM team were very helpful and responsive in helping get the newsletter sign up form set up and working for Roche colleagues (a bit of troubleshooting needed). HM helping with small project queries as always. - MS: Good job!\n\n\n\n\nSent out a newsletter!\n\nMS: super exciting to see the newsletter out!\n\nMade start on Genomics England doc\n\nMS: Notes below!\n\nTeam charter doc basic draft in place\n\nMS: Good job! Considering switching to GitHub is a good idea. Also really appreciate that you are already thinking about the expert panel’s input on the roadmap.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas lots of fiddly bits to make the newsletter work but now the template in place will be much easier next month.\n\nMS: I have never used this before. Great work getting this sorted. I have signed up - maybe sign up for anyone from the leadership team.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst time lab goatherding\n\nMS: Amazing! Looking forward to hearing your take on Slack on CM.\n\nGetting team charter to a more finished state\n\nMS: Really great to see you, HM and MOG are working so well.

Have a couple of optional co-working sessions for attendees this week and early next- think seeing how attended these are will be a useful temperature of current level of engagement. Have started stakeholder/contact mapping and have a good list of what I think may need setting up e.g newsletter- but don’t feel at the point that I can ‘start’ any of these actions just yet.\n\n\n\nHave put together a ‘to-do’ document which has helped focus my thinking on what is needed for the partnership going forward. Also did an Open canvas. Am slightly nervous about ensuring attendees are in working groups for the workshop 3 presentations as not much response so far.\n\n\n\nNothing comes to mind for now.\n\n\n\nCan you have a public Github but make some documents on it private?

Gave feedback in stakeholder mapping.\nAB in helping with reimbursement through the Certify platform.\nKW in reaching out to DSG session. Offered to help with the session facilitation.\n\n\n\n\n\nMet RP in person - discussed scicomm story, and the REG project. Language for data analysis and visualisation to enable adding a layer of. Trying to add in a private repo.\nRan the DSG workshop last week, it was daunting in the beginning but went really well. KW was there to help and step in.\nSome very productive chats with ASG stakeholders\nSubmitted the SMART goal\nPublic engagement workshop was good\n\n\n\n\n\nNeed to meet individual members of ASG to understand the community\n\nWho among the core stakeholders you have not yet managed to meet?\n\nCan identify connections once I speak to individual members\n“Nobody knows how this community-building looks like.” What are the needs? What are the connections that exist between teams?\n\nI think many of us have the vision for ASG community and overview of how building them would look like. I hope discussion earlier in the week was useful, howeever, we should block a day to work on sketching out some concrete strategy and timeline to share them with others. This will help in communicating what we want to achieve and where we might be misaligned - which would be a place to further feedback and iteration, and especially for engagement.\n\nDocumenting queries, create pathways\n\nHow can we work towards making them visible?\n\n“Have I let the ASG PDRAs know what my agenda is beyond the white papers?”\nHM and KW with planning of ASG workshop agenda\nJD with Equadratures glossy\n\n\n\n\n[N.B.: Didn’t actively take notes in this meeting.]\n\nASG-meeting went well!\nSet up a repo, created Slack channels, OverLeaf\n\n\n\n\nWho did you work with this week? - EK for demonstrating an internal GitHub repo as an example for project management, and then sharing notes following a meeting with DC about measuring impact - HM for recognising my workload and offering to cut me out of some planning meetings - KH for speaking with me about an ASG CTP and introducing me to half a dozen people by e-mail - RW for joining lunchtime call with PDRAs, and JD and AC for supporting - LM for testing Overleaf with me\n\n\n\nWho did you work with this week? - Thanks to AC, DA, CD for joining the lunchtime agenda-building call and giving me invaluable input into the agenda items - Also to HM and AY for help with refining the ASG event agenda - Huge thanks to MS for assorted advice, guidance and patience during community-related meetings, and for taking the whole of Friday to co-work with me on growing the ASG community and getting over my GitHub-related fears - Slowly but surely I feel I’m growing into the role - Started to put together notes and ideas into the GitHub repo for the ASG community - The ASG event in March has potential for community building: I need to make sure the opportunity is not lost - Putting together cross-CTP (hah!) panels, poster sessions, virtual booths etc. - Also involving RAMs - AC with an application for Enrichment Project Collaborations - SG with assorted Binder-related stuff - Was able to take on board feedback/input from community members to define an agenda for the ASG meeting in March that are happy with! - Refactored the various ASG-community-related repos and issues into a single one, with Malvika’s advice - Closed one long TTW PR that I had been in the process of reviewing for ages\n\n\n\n\nThe ASG event is shaping up well!\nComms have gone out and a few more have registered.\nReached out to some individuals from the community to test the waters of the proposed sessions and got positive feedback.\nThanks in particular to HM for help with the ASG event, to DC for an insightful discussion on measuring the health of communities and to KW for advice on how to conduct lightning talks.\nWhite papers are a little behind the (optimistic) schedule because the ASG event is taking up more of my time than I had anticipated\nFor the event, we are still lacking lightning talks at the moment. KW shared on how to conduct lightning talks\nContacted all external PDRAs about Slack, and at least two have asked to join\nDid some tidying of the ASG Community repo\nSpoke with Scivision team during their coworking calls to discuss ASG event participation following suggestion from BM and JR\nStarted with Community Management worksheets, but haven’t finished\nFinalise ASG event sessions and speakers\n\nThursday/Friday\n\nReview (with BM) the lightning-talk applications\n\nPart of Thursday morning\n\nCatch up and follow up on white papers\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to HM and AY for all their behind-the-scenes help with organising the event\nMS and KW gave me lots of advice on how to run the various sessions\nMet JS and BC at 1:1 networking and discussed collaborating with them\nSocial lunch was really good with so many sharing their hobbies and interests\nTook some time to understand how much I had to be involved in shaping of the event. Lots of connections and learning experiences. HM was great support. AY helped so much behind the scene.\nNeed to schedule a debrief meeting. AY has also shared a document to add details.\nASG community building got a boost from last week’s event\n\nPlanning with HS on organising regular “meet-up” sessions for ASG PDRAs\nHS was told by some PDRAs that they felt isolated with their projects from the rest of ASG, and we want to address that\nWill investigate whether we can get budgets for reimbursed meals for monthly/quarterly social lunches\n\nJL is unavailable to help with SPARRA glossy so HS asked if I could help: realised that we can recycle lightning talk that other JLy gave at ASG event\nStarted but didn’t advance with repurposing the sessions content for notes for white papers\nHad meeting with MC about impact measurement, spoke with JS and HR about their projects\nQuite a bit that I’m pleased with\n\nThe ASG event itself went well from a logistics PoV (with one tiny hiccup)\nI got feedback from a couple of the speakers that they enjoyed the panels they were on\nThe lightning talks went smooooothly and speakers got to discuss their work in longer breakout sessions\n\nFollowing the event, I’ve had some discussions with people I met for the first time (including one longer conversation that will hopefully feed into the E&S white paper that came entirely from the 1:1 networking)\nStaying on top of the E&S white paper itself\nFollow up with speakers who have not replied to ask about putting their talks on Zenodo\nDiscuss Poscast idea with BC, sometime next week, if BC is available\nWill be attending the DT:UA meeting at the office on Tuesday\n\n\n\n\n\nPiecing together white paper plans and July events\nGuideline for white paper\n\nMiro board or some sort of visual aid for what forms the ASG community\nMaybe a workshop for preparing research objects to share with white paper\n\nVisual representation of ASG community and outcomes\n\nExample from stakeholder mapping: https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/turingrochemapping3184/1644491751192?sender=u9bd79b8433bbff7b44831689&key=894dc697-7b47-45c2-a689-0960452100cb\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeen making notes in a notebook to gather various snippets into one place before putting it online into the asg-community repo\nWrote down vision for project as part of OLS-5 mentorship\nStarted working on Open Canvas (almost done) and using input from Roadmaps exercise to update schedule for white papers\nGot good feedback on the use of GitHub issues at ASG Management Board, but was told I could provide more clarity: need to make proper labels\nCleared some (not a lot) of my e-mail backlog, which feels like a bigger achievement than it is\nStarted consolidating notes for the white papers from various sources\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally launched the E&S white paper. Felt like a weight off my shoulder, as I hadn’t managed to move forward with it for some time. Launched the drafting phase for the first ASG white paper, which felt a bit overwhelming to get out of the docks.\nHad a good chat with BC about the potential for ASG podcast episodes/mini-series; see https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/asg-community/issues/53.\nHaven’t really had any proper community time lately, but that should change in May once we move to the July hybrid event.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, there were no edits to the document while I was away. Going to start engaging the post-docs directly now as we might not get much direct engagement from the senior researchers.\nContacting post-docs and others recommended by core team to contribute to the E&S white paper; setting up co-working slots for this week and beyond and inviting them to it\nMeeting with ASG central about July event (Thursday); includes debrief from March event\nHave to upload ASG March event talks (been low priority, but now has been two months since the event)\nStart working on SPARRA glossy\n\n\n\n\n\nThree new contributors have joined the E&S white paper! Will be doing their on-boarding over Slack and Zoom.\nJD has been curating resources and ideas for the EDT white paper.\nHad meetings with AC about health summary, with JD about a mapping social for the July event, and with HS, MC and ZI about the August event after meeting ASG central last week (with follow-up with AY today)\nZI has been ace, and has set up a Gantt chart for the July event and has also provided me with a list of potential areas for the PDRAs to engage with at the event.\nASG mini-series for Turing podcast is moving ahead; had two meetings with BCG and DW about logistics; see https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/asg-community/issues/53/.\nHave not managed to set up co-working slots but will have to do so for after the Book Dash.\nSome point to consider:\n\ninvolve ZI in putting together a time line combined with outputs and stakeholders.\nWhere can the leadership provide steer and support in your work?\nWhere can you protect your time for white papers?\n\nJD circulated a pre-meeting survey to the EDT PDRAs before this evening’s workshop and shared the results with myself and DAB.\nBCG and DW for enthusiasm and ideas for the ASG podcast mini-series\nSent out personal invitations for participation in E&S white papers\nDrafted short text for BM to circulate to core team\nHad multiple meetings to scope out ASG podcast mini-series\nHad multiple meetings to move forward July ASG event\nScoped out potential evening social around mapping at July event with JD\nHad meeting with BM, JR, HS and VH about a series of workshops to be organised by a Nature journal and Turing+STFC; been asked to help organise the workshops\nContacting ASG PDRAs about July event to shape agenda and seek contributors for facilitating workshops\nPreparing communications to send out to ASG for the July event (priority)\nResponding to some e-mails that have been ignored for too long\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHave had some very productive meetings with ZI about the ASG event, and the plans are moving forward quite well (more below).\nNew contributors to the white papers have been making edits to the document and I’ve also had a co-working session with some (more below as well).\n\n\n\n\nHave had some agenda-planning meetings with ASG central team, HS, ZI, MC and AY.\nI have run the tentative agenda past several PDRAs to get their input on the sessions we have planned.\nWorked with ZI to prepare comms (mostly ZI; I only checked) for the event.\nWent to Birmingham with ZI yesterday to scope out the venue and speak with the venue representative about potential sessions.\nHave worked with JD, DC and AS on the mapathon session at the social event.\n\n\n\n\n\nThoroughly helpful conversations with ZI and ZE have given me renewed energy for the white papers; ZI has prepared a project tracking document and ZI is keen to be involved in the weekly meetings.\nNew contributors have been onboarded and have made their first contributions.\nHad a co-working slot all Friday afternoon and co-worked with two PDRAs during that time.\nAC has offered to also help with the overall messaging of the document as they have experience working on such documents.\nAttended (remotely) the meeting to plan the Nature-Turing workshops in September/October, and provided my input for how to proceed; there will be some community-organising work there, but I will need help as it will overlap quite a bit with my white-papers schedules and I won’t be able to devote full attention to it.\nBeginning editing the ASG white paper now that most have fed into the document.\nContact potential speakers/presenters for ASG event and finalise the panels."

These address key issues for policy-makers and other stakeholders on the future of AI in science and government. The documents are being co-created by all members of the ASG community and shared openly for further development and reuse.\nOne of the primary outcomes will be a portfolio of three community-written white papers, which will offer an opportunity for ASG as a programme to reflect on:\n\nlearnings using evidence from ASG research,\nkey challenges that have emerged,\nrecommendations for the future, and\npossible calls-to-action for the wider research community, government, policymakers and the public.\n\nThe titles of these papers and associated communication materials will be defined by three Core Groups focusing on:\n\nusing data science to predict and protect from future societal shocks\nDigital Twins as a revolution in engineering and beyond\nthe role of AI in creating a healthy, sustainable, environment and responding to climate change\n\nBeyond the white papers, we will also use different models of communication such as data visualisation, illustrations, executable code, storytelling approaches, impact reports, case studies, podcasts, video recordings and follow-on technical papers. These resources will pull together the different strands of ASG research and be easily digestible and accessible to a wide audience.\n:speaker: Communication channels and pathways\n\nWe will use four channels for communication:\n\nGitHub repository:\n\nAbout: This repository is used for sharing updates and resources crucial for enabling community collaboration, transparent communication and project management.\nAccess: Shared openly under CC-BY 4.0 License\n\nTuring Slack Workspace:\n\nAbout: For day-to-day communication, we will use the Slack channel: #asg-members. For White Paper related conversations, please use #asg-white-papers.\nAccess: The Turing members have access by default. External contributors should contact Achintya to be added by invitation.\n\nOverleaf:\n\nAbout: We have selected Overleaf as the authoring platform for co-developing the white papers as it is approved by the Turing data protection and the Legal team.\nAccess: All contributors will be added to the team account.

Beginning to see trends, and carving out some time during the week to digest notes, and sort through some initial findings. Going to do another round of outreach today (and maybe try to reach into the archives of the project).\n\nWho did you help this week?\n\nSpoke to YB about the Fireside. We shared notes & made plans for outreach and meeting people. She’s reaching out to people about co-facilitating, and we’re going to send out a collective email by the end of the week.\nGave an idea at CollabW22 that seemed to be well-received!\n\n\n\nWho helped you this week?\n\nSo many people! Many people in TTW. I think I’m learning about the collaborative nature of the slack workspace in particular, and how much of a group effort it really is.\nThank you for emailing S about the Fireside!\nSpoke to ACC about translation late last week - truly amazing! Similar to the Turing - I was wondering if we should make an ‘appreciations’ channel where maybe we can do shoutouts to people within the project? Or I (and others) can start posting interesting things I’m learning about the project?\nEveryone at CollabW22!! Learning so much it’s unbelievable!\nThinking about the Slack - and how much I’m learning from the shear number of resources and things that people are sharing.\n\n\n\nWhat did you achieve?\n\nFinally released the issue describing community research in TTW. Positive reactions so far - now to embed documentation throughout the whole process!\nLearning a lot from CW22, and will be releasing another ‘community learning’ update to the issue this week.\n\n\n\nWhat did you struggle with?\n\nI was struggling last week with wanting/trying to do everything at the same time… But this week I’ve tried to take breaks and stop (with a little humor) when it gets too much. It helped! Slow & steady.\n\n\n\nWhat would you like to work on next week?\n\nI really need to reserve all of next week to work on more of the technical side of the project. There’s so much important work and labor there that I need time to dig into.\nLearn about the Fireside workflow\nStart working on the project update from AB w/ MS\n\n\n\nWhere do you need help?\n\nI was thinking that it could be great to get a transcription software, where I can record the chats I’m having with people, and upload the audio to a service (like Amberscript) so I can categorise findings more easily (instead of taking notes during the call - which can be distracting). What do you think?\nI’ve been drafting a twitter thread to post, relating back to the fireside chat. Wasn’t able to post this week - so I was thinking this Friday, it could be posted?"

Thank you for taking the time to get to know the community. Also, delighted to see you take the lead on the Fireside Chat.\n\n\n\nWhat did you achieve?\n\nSystem set up + research. Same as last week.\nWill be setting up a folder in ‘community building’ to hold methodology, while putting TTW-issues with findings and aims directly into the TTW.\nStarting to get up to speed on internal Turing partnerships, and upcoming projects.\nMS: I am so impressed by your process documentation skills. We are so delighted that you are taking your community mapping in open and sharing them in TTW.\n\n\n\nWhat did you struggle with?\n\nStruggling to balance speed with efficacy. Keep needing to remind myself that speed isn’t the most important, and that I should just focus on people.\nMS: We are giving you a lot of information and that is in some ways unavoidable, but there is no expectation that you will know how they fit together immediately. Please take your time to learn about the project, people and ways of working. This is a huge investment that will pay off, and especially through your notes we will gain insights on what opportunities for engagement and support we can create. Please use this time to explore - speed and efficacy is not priorities here - observing and recording is extremely valuable already.\n\n\n\nWhat would you like to work on next week?\n\nMore of the same!\nMS: THANK YOU! :) Please do take a break from meetings to decompress as needed.\n\n\n\nWhere do you need help?\n\nHopefully to review my study findings/info so far at TTW visioning!\nMS: Booked some coworking sessions. Talk to you soon!"

I think we need to start offering that - we could get this maybe free through ONS. * What do you think healthcare in the UK is? - about structure of NHS primary and secondary care or more about health data research environment in UK? seems very wide topic. * could also add healthcare legal framework here - gdpr, NHS NDOO etc, caldicott guardian/prinicples and this https://www.england.nhs.uk/ig/ig-resources/ * this platform can be used for training for nhs data security - https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/data-security-awareness/ * Section 5 - writing collab documents add google docs here too, science communication - very wide - what do you mean? writing for wider audiences? using communication tools?\n\n\nAny other topics"

Since Monday I’ve been focusing on RSF things, which has been lovely.\n\n\n\n\nCO can’t make it to the Collab Cafe next week after all - the plan was to discuss data ethics applications and a couple of the project managers said they’d be there to discuss that.

    "text": "This document is adapted from the ELIXIR-UK RDM bites recording tips - written by Xènia Pérez Sitjà. * Funded by the ELIXIR-UK: FAIR Data Stewardship training UKRI award (MR/V038966/1)\n\n\n1. Headphones or external microphones * If you have headphones with incorporated microphones, use them. * If you use this option, please do not grab the mic. * Let it fall naturally — without excessively rubbing against your clothes/hair. * Whichever microphone you use you need to keep one thing in mind: Direct the microphone towards your throat, not your mouth. Microphones pick up the sounds coming from your throat, instead of your mouth and lips. This is the reason why lapel microphones are placed on lapels and pointed towards your throat, never your mouth.\n2. Without headphones * If you don’t have headphones, you will have to use the one from your laptop. So make sure you are not moving objects on the table and that your computer doesn’t have the funs at a very high speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAVOID\nLOOK FOR\n\n\n\n\nSmall, box rooms. Your bathroom is the wrong place to record voice\nCosy spaces with soft furnishings: pillows, chairs, sofas… These prevent echoes and unpleasant background noises.\n\n\nMoving objects on the table\nSitting down far away from walls. The closer to the middle of the room, the better.\n\n\nUnfurnished rooms\n\n\n\nSitting down next to walls\n\n\n\nOpening windows\n\n\n\nAny constant background noise: air conditioner, fans, trains, traffic…\n\n\n\n\nTip: Clap a couple of times and listen. Do you notice some echo? If you do, move somewhere else.\n\n\n\nStay calm and pause. Often, we tend to talk as fast as possible, especially when talking about a topic we are enthusiastic or nervous about.\n\nPauses are good, they are a friendly, useful tool we should use constantly. They can give that needed emphasis to a specific word or statement. They build expectation or make the listener pay attention to what comes next.\nTalk slow. When you read some text that you know by heart, often you read it faster. Bear in mind that for the person that hears it for the first time, he/she will need a little extra. Keep your speed constant and slow, but strong.\nTry to use your natural tone, as you would do in a normal conversation. If you are excited, show it with your tone. If you are serious about important facts, demonstrate them with your voice. In explanatory videos, facial expressions are completely lost, so the tone of your voice directs the entire message.\n\nVideos should never be a boring Q&A session/seminar. People often want to hear real conversations, so don’t forget to enjoy them and create a relaxed and fun atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\nWe often hate to hear ourselves on a recording, but this step is vital to ensure a good video. We are not looking for a professional production video, and we don’t expect you to build a BBC top audio recording, but we need to make sure the audio is accessible and understandable.\nSo, test your first recording before continuing with all your videos:\n\nDo you hear loud background noise?\nDoes your microphone rub against your clothes (if you use one)?\nIs your voice loud and clear?\nAre you speaking at a good pace but not too fast?"

    "text": "Apple M1 Homebrew Installation\nThere are documented issues with installing Homebrew (a popular package manager used by data scientists, developers, and research software engineers) on new Apple computers that come with the Apple Silicon (M1 or M2) chips.\nSide Note: If you don't have your Mac set up with a password (including if the password is blank) you will not be able to install Homebrew.\nTo install Homebrew on machines running in Apple Silicon, run through the following steps:\n\n0. Check Installs\nRun the usual checks to see if homebrew is installed:\nFor example, run brew doctor in your terminal. If the command returns a message that homebrew is not installed, continue with the rest of the guide.\nOr if it is % brew, then that’s okay!\nBut you want to be checking the $PATH prefix to see if it’s /usr/local/bin (the standard place Homebrew installs which works for Intel chips) or if /opt/homebrew is on your $PATH which makes Homebrew Apple Silicon friendly.\nSo to debug:\n\n\n1. Install Homebrew\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\nOn Apple Silicon machines the Homebrew files are installed into the /opt/homebrew folder. But the folder is not part of the default $PATH so we need to create a ~/.zprofile file which contains a command which sets up Homebrew.\n\n\n2. Create a ~/.zprofile file\nRun the following two commands: in your terminal echo 'eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"' >> /Users/sbatchelor/.zprofile eval \"$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\"\n\n\n3. Check the install\nRun brew doctor which should return Your system is ready to brew if things worked properly.\nOn Apple Silicon, if you see zsh: command not found: brew, check that you’ve created a ~/.zprofile file as described above and restart terminal.\nIf Homebrew is successfully installed, there will be Homebrew files in /opt/homebrew and you’ll get the Your system is ready to brew message after running brew doctor.\n\n\n\nAlternative routes:\nIf the above didn’t work then the stackoverflow consensus is that the following commands will work (but I haven’t tried them myself):\ngit clone https://github.com/Homebrew/brew homebrew eval \"$(homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)\" brew update --force --quiet chmod -R go-w \"$(brew --prefix)/share/zsh\""

    "text": "Collaboration among the community managers and researchers across different projects is crucial for the success of the Open Research Community Building projects. The Turing Way is an excellent project to bring all community managers and researchers together under the same umbrella as core members and contributors.\nThe Turing Way is a flagship project to ensure that best practices in data science and research are consistently promoted across all projects at the institute. The Turing Way is used not only by researchers at The Alan Turing Institute but more broadly by people working in data science at the national and international research communities. Hence, it is important to consider what practices from our projects are transferable and should be shared in The Turing Way to benefit other researchers.\nIn addition to the broader scope described in the project (see Working with The Turing Way), below you will find some specific pathways for the core team members to engage with The Turing Way community.\n\n\nThe Turing Way team has been hosting shorter coworking calls each week. These calls are similar to the Collaboration Cafes, but only 1-hour long. Since May 2020, these calls have been taking place multiple days each week at 11:00 GMT/BST. It is not hosted on the days when there is a Collaboration Cafe already scheduled. Please read about the Coworking Calls on The Turing Way.\nWe encourage all community managers to attend these co-working calls. Chair for each week will be assigned based on who from the core team is available and joining that week. Please familiarise yourself with the format, resources and what involves in the participation and chairing of Coworking Calls.\n\n\n\nThe Turing Way Collaboration Cafes (or ‘Cafés’ with an accent) are virtual co-working spaces that are held fortnightly on the first and third Wednesdays of each month for 2 hours. Please read about the Collaborate Cafes on The Turing Way.\nWe encourage all community managers to attend Collaboration Cafes regularly. The chair for each Collaboration Cafe will be assigned based on who from the core team is available and joining that week. Please familiarise yourself with the format, resources and what involves in the participation and chairing of Coworking Calls.\n\n\n\nThe Turing Way Book Dash events are a less intense version of Book Sprints, where participants collaboratively work on The Turing Way book synchronously. Most of our collaboration in The Turing Way happen asynchronously, hence the Book Dash is organised to bring together interested members either in person for 1-2 full days or small sessions each day for a week (2.5 hours long, organised in multiple time zones) when organised online to develop new chapters and review/edit existing ones to make them more accessible, comprehensive and up-to-date. They also contribute to enhancing the project by improving the ways we work in the community and taking the lead on accomplishing different tasks or subprojects. Please read about the Book Dash on The Turing Way.\nWe encourage all community managers to attend set aside time for one or both Book Dash annually. This will be an opportunity to document practices from their projects in The Turing Way chapters, collaborate with others within and beyond the team on shared interests, become part of the Book Dash planning committee if already participated in a previous Book Dash or take on other community-facing roles (mentor, reviewer, chair, social media manager) for the event.\n\n\n\nThe Turing Way Fireside chat series feature experts, champions and their projects from across different international communities in reproducibility, open research, ethics, collaboration and everything in between. This is an opportunity for catalysing cross-community collaboration and knowledge sharing. Previous topics include an introduction to The Turing Way, shared concerns in cross-community collaboration and translation in data science. Find details in the Fireside Chat HackMD.\nYou are invited to design and chair future discussions that can include topics related but not limited to building cross-community collaborations, establishing context-specific support systems and working together towards global sustainability of the open infrastructure."

Through the active adoption of open research, reproducibility and collaborative approaches in data science projects, they contribute toward building interconnected systems of open source software, datasets, communities and processes.\nTogether as a team, we ensure that the research that happens at the Institute is created to be maintained, sustained, remixed and reused to make research and innovation more efficient and effective across the national and international data science ecosystem for commercial and public interest technologies alike.\nThe way we work inside the SRE will always change - whether that is because we get new data, update software packages or fixing bugs that make the SRE run smoothly. This means the SRE Wiki should change with it to provide up to date documentation for EDoN SRE users. This page provides a guide on how to contribute to maintaining the wiki so that it works for everyone."

    "text": "How is the Wiki built?\nThe SRE Wiki is built with Quarto - an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built by Posit PBC. Unlike Jupyter Book or RMarkdown, it isn’t a package that belongs to a programming language, it’s a javascript based cli program that supports embedding multple languages within Quarto documents. Part of building and maintaining the Wiki is deciding what tools we use to build it and this might change if we think it’s the best thing to do.\n\nHow do I work with Quarto to edit the Wiki?\nWorking with Quarto is largely working with markdown files. Where GitHub, GitLab, HackMD use vanilla .md markdown files to write README files etc, or R uses .Rmd RMarkdown files to write notebooks and shiny applications, Quarto has it’s own flavour of markdown file called a .qmd file. If you have ever edited a markdown file before, you will be at home with writing markdown files in Quarto - and this is mostly all you need to build this wiki.\n\n\nThe _quarto.yml file\nThe other important file for this Wiki, and for Quarto in general is the _quarto.yml file. The reason you see links on the navigation bar, or sections on the left sidebar is because they are specified to look that way in the _quarto.yml. This file basically wants the Wiki to be organized into sub-directories, where you tell _quarto.yml where to render and serve each sub-directory. It is common to see an index.qmd file in every subdirectory to act as a landing page for that sub-directory.\nThe Quarto official documentation can be found at \n\n\nMarkdown files created this website for the Wiki?\nAlmost\nGitLab has a feature called GitLab Pages that serves files such as markdown as a static website. In particular the GitLab repository looks for a _gitlab-ci.yml file that gives instructions to build the repository and serve as a website, as well as other jobs such as building a container from a Docker image.\nThe existing _gitlab-ci.yml file for the Wiki will rarely need to be modified, but it’s worth being aware of to understand how GitLab builds the website for the Wiki."

    "text": "Are there any other considerations?\nContainers!\nAny project that involves code can get a bit messy, even with version control. One reason is that mutliple collaborators might be using different software locally to someone else. Imagine putting a graph on the Wiki that uses a certain version of matplotlib that might break if someone runs the same code, but with a different version of matplotlib on their machine? We might also be using different versions on the Quarto binary (although perhaps we should co-ordinate that!).\nOne thing we can do is to try and ensure we are using the same versions of software when we are building and testing the Wiki locally, so that when we push those changes to GitLab, they will always work for someone when they pull to their local machine.\nThis can be really annoying to co-ordinate without any help, especially with a project that uses multiple languages. conda can help you create multi-language virtual environments that can manage package versions for langauges without effecting the main install on your machine. However an even cleaner way is to use Containers - and in our case Docker. A Docker container builds a fresh new Operating System that contains a specific set of software and this container can be shared about and used as any othe operating system. With a .Dockerfile we can specify all of what goes into the container in advance such as the Quarto version, versions of Python/R packages etc.\nThe Wiki is built from and comes with a Docker container for you to use. You can find the latest container here  and the lastest version of the .Dockerfile that built it here .\nThe idea is to run the Docker container on your local machine and edit your local version of Wiki repository from within the Docker container. This way we can ensure that everyone has the same local environment when developing the Wiki. You can find more information on how to run this Wiki’s Docker container in the Containers section."
