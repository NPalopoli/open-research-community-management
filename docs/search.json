This means if you want create a Pull Request to edit the wiki, you will want to merge any branches with gh-pages rather than main."

Some IDEs already come included with Quarto:\n\nVSCode + VSCode Quarto Extension\nRStudio (comes with Quarto)\n\nOr you could download the Quarto CLI if you like working on a terminal.\n\nCan I just edit directly on GitHub?\nSoon! We are working on integrating the Quarto GitHub Action and Deploy Preview to allow rendering and deployment entirely from with the GitHub repository."

This takes you directly to the page on the GitLab website and you can edit directly - don’t forget to create a new branch at the bottom of the page on GitLab when you commit these changes!"

    "text": "How do I work with Quarto to edit the Wiki?\nWorking with Quarto is largely working with markdown files. Where GitHub and HackMD use vanilla .md markdown files to write README files, Quarto has it’s own flavour of markdown file called a .qmd file. If you have ever edited a markdown file before, you will be at home with writing markdown files in Quarto - and this is mostly all you need to build this wiki.\n\nThe _quarto.yml file\nThe other important file for this Wiki, and for Quarto in general is the _quarto.yml file. The reason you see links on the navigation bar, or sections on the left sidebar is because they are specified to look that way in the _quarto.yml.\n\n\nFile structure of the website\nThe index.qmd at the base of the repository serves the homepage. Any other sections on the website exist as a subdirectory of _site/. For example, the page you are viewing now is built from _site/contributing/index.qmd. In the quarto.yml file there will be a reference to this file path in the section that defines the top navigation pane."
