<ul>
<li>Last week we chatted about having a sync meeting: the Ops meeting on Thursday served that in terms of updates, and EZ and I also grabbed DC on Thursday for a chit chat 🚀</li>
<li>EZ is taking lead on the GitHub workshop next week, they’re an absolute rockstar and I’m super grateful that it’s taken off my plate.</li>
<li>There’s one call that needed to be rescheduled, but I’ve now met with 19 PPIE leads/co-applicants over the past 3 weeks 🚀</li>
<li>Overall I think internal comms were really good last week.</li>
<li>There’s enough to tackle locally right now, but I do need to be chipping away at building external connections to communities as the conference has been mentioned a few times in the past week.
<ul>
<li>EK - you are relient on the stakeholder mapping - check in with the progress of this and see if it can be shared with you for checking progress and additions from you as well.</li>

I’ve sent some details on specific work tasks DC’s way and offered help for whenever it’s needed. PPIE lead is still away, but DC and EB have indicated that they don’t have specific asks yet. * External AIM-RSF website is almost up and running (have been making content changes based off suggestions from a Monday afternoon meeting) and is a priority for this week ahead of events coming up.</p>
<p><strong>PPIE &amp; Constortia Meetings</strong><br>
* Have been meeting with PPIE leads 1:1 and starting having larger meetings with Consortia leads (with DC &amp; MF) that have provided so much insight!! This has been 2 weeks in the works getting set up.</p>
<p><strong>GitHub &amp; Community Building work</strong> * Have been supporting EZ with collating GitHub training materials while also doing bitty tasks with the repositories (CoC’s, Project boards, GitHub Actions, Issues, Onboarding, reviewing PR’s etc). * ⚠️ Ran into a major blocker that EB has flagged around IT, GitHub, and Slack. As of today, we are continuing ahead as it’s for the higher ups to figure out.<br>
* 🤦 Had issues with cross-consortia comms, email invites, and meeting links so no one showed up to Evelina’s talk. We’ve set out a bit of a plan for how to approach this in the future. * EK - thanks for flagging these issues.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-did-you-struggle-with-13">What did you struggle with?</h4>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Overwhlem</strong> Feeling a smidge overwhelmed as some tasks are taking longer than expected this past week. Trying to keep working hours is proving a bit hard as I feel guilty about not getting things done in the expected timeframe (i.e.&nbsp;noticed lots of typos in the ethics form and some of the questions were different than the TREx approach so it’s still an open task).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Keeping track of tasks.</strong> I need to rebuild up some form of task tracking system as I’m getting pings for small requests that I can do, but forget what they’re related to and need to move on to the next thing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Summary Email/Notes</strong> I fell out of habit writing end of day summaries last week so had a monster job on friday pulling it all together into an email and sending it out (was favouring getting to bed early as I’m up early on some calls with California last week and this). I’ve picked the daily logs back up this week but not having sent out that email (and even just curating it for myself) have left a massive gap in internal comms.</p>
<ul>
<li>EK - you are doing great so try not to feel overwhelmed - you are progressing on tasks so making progress. Project boards sounds like a good future plan for task tracking. Summary notes - they are hard to maintain so maybe doing this verbally or putting your personal summaries in a doc on github so you don’t have to clean up?</li>

<li>LC is away for the next few weeks and the NIHR report deadline is coming up so I’m stepping up with DC to fill in some PPIE gaps, the Drugs Coding work is getting set up quick as the wave 1 funding is wrapping up soon so quite a few projects have deadlines to meet.</li>
<li>The new Data Wrangler is getting a lot put on their plate, and EZ has some space to wrap their head around things.</li>
<li>I haven’t heard much about the stakeholder mapping task and Mural is blocked so it seems like Excel might be a good place for things at this point in time.</li>
<li>The TREx ethics forms may not have been the correct ones to fill out based on the current handover for TREx - Tony and Vanessa have been emailed to get more clarity on this.</li>

<p>Feeling a bit stuck in places due to not having a clear picture of what’s going on inside the consortia. We need to get an information processing piece in place, and after that’s confirmed then I might be able to start reaching out to folk and having coffee chats to get an idea of what’s going on. So I’m feeling a bit stuck unable to identify the known unknowns, and daunted but unknown unknowns. * EK - get yourself invited to project meetings so that you can be that lurker - listen for people of interest and also tasks you can intervene.</p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>these are easy wins as they’re ‘learning’ and ‘get to know folk’ focused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Big Win:</strong> 🌟 I made a flyer (that I was quite proud of) and drafted up information about the ECR lunch session to be sent out. * EK - the flyer looks fab.</p>
<p>Community Management: * ✅ Have got access to the GitHub Repo and Sharepoint and am familair with the contents * ✅ found an area of the NIHR AIM site which has docs on PPIE here * ✅ Gained better understanding of the challenges some groups are facing in terms of data access and sharing of methods. * ✅ Attended first RSF seminar * ✅ Attended first RSF Ops meeting (and made a few suggestions) * ✅ Reached out to events team to understand what their role is and how my role and theirs can work together * ✅ Read through Sharepoint files and got up to speed some more</p>
<p>PPIE/Focus Groups: * ✅ Read through the TREx forms and have started scoping what sort of questions the focus groups are needed for. * ✅ Had meeting wih Georgia to learn about how AutSPACEs approached focus groups.</p>
<p>General Learning: * ✅ Attended seminar from MSF Scientific Days International on community involvement in their organisation’s projects.</p>

<li>Current tasks are about getting up to speed with where things are at with the RSF, and what sort of work do I need to muck in on short term.
<ul>
<li>There seems to be a good opportunity to lead with some Turing Way workflows in how notes and the like are stored &amp; shared. Will need to have a few scoping conversations to figure out what the best way forward will be.
<ul>
<li>EK - let’s chat about DECOVID repo when you start working no your repository.<br>
</li>
<li>This presents a small challenge as putting a line in the sand and forcing everything into markdown and github may not meet the community where they are and so deep thinking is needed.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Worked to integrate reviewer feedback for a conference submission on AutSPACEs with GA. Am exploring/figuring out what the split between AutSPACEs and AIM will be.

<li>Feeling like I’m not necessarily doing “tasks” at the moment. Am just unsure of if I should be working harder and mucking in more: and am finding the balance difficult between the phd mindset vs working life mindset where it’s okay to not solve all the world’s problems in a day.

<li>EK - start a few of the tasks from your list sent last friday such as community mapping and glossary - drawing info together that you have and then asking for input.</li>
