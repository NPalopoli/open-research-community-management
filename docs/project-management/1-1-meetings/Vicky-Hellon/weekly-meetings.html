<p>All going well so far this year. Happy to have got the newsletter out this morning. Got a funding call Q&amp;A session on Weds which will be a good opportunity to engage with the community and then should have some breathing space to finalise team charter etc with MG and HM before funding call closes and expert panel meeting at end of Jan. - MS: Lots of applications are in the draft version. So amazing!</p>
