I’ve been doing a lot of socialising with the community members this week which has been fantastic 💗 - the R workshop went really well and I got some really nice feedback, - I’ve been prioritising meeting new hires in one-to-one chats which has been lovely - the ECR lunchtime session didn’t have a massive turnout but we had a really nice chat and someone even fed back that they immediately had a use case for HackMD 🙀 - I had a PI show up to the office hours which was really nice (he’s part of the CoP for stats I’m building connections with) - I met up with another person from the CoP from MRC and she was absolutely lovely and has tons of relevant expertise - EK - this sounds like great community building work! :raised_hands:</p>

<p>I will have just had a meeting with the acting DPO so I’ll probably want to catch you up on that. Points from the discussion: - can you get rid of someone data - look at chapter in TTW sensitive data chapters. - Can a search be done on GitHub for someones information - what about private repositories? how are they accessed by a search or someone that does not have access to them? - international data transfer</p>

<p>September has been intense in general, last week was no exception. I’m happy with how the Connections workshop went and I had a lot of good/useful meetings, but at the end of it I was completely wiped.

I also helped host a panel session on a project I’ve been working on for a while called Coding Confessions. I also finally met most of the people I worked on this with, except for Patricia!</li>

<p>Things were kind of slow the last couple of weeks, partly because of personal things and partly because people were away. There has been some progress though: I’ve met with all project managers now, given the first GitHub follow-up session, have a version of the skills/training survey I’m reasonably happy with, and started organsing things a bit more on GitHub. SB and I also started having weekly sync ups which I think will be very useful.</p>

<p>EK - onboarding documents on Github repo - how is that going?</p>
<p>EK - survey feedback * Q2 - change other academic staff to academic infrastructure roles, just clinical staff is ok I think - they could put something in other if they want. or clinical - doctor versus clinical research staff? * Q3 - I suspect that most of them will not understand what we mean by open and repro so they will probably be satisfied - what do you want to get out of this question? is it really needed? * Q4 - is good ! Make fair principles as a separate option to open data and code. I think I would have FAIR, open data and code, reproducible research, research data/software management, open access publishing. * Section 3 - do you think you need to define the topics more - short definitions so thats people are super clear what each is about? * Q12 - do you want to add Git? * Section 4 topics need to be defined as well - maybe also add working in secure environments - I’m thinking of the accredited researcher training that is needed for data safe havens. I think we need to start offering that - we could get this maybe free through ONS. * What do you think healthcare in the UK is? - about structure of NHS primary and secondary care or more about health data research environment in UK? seems very wide topic. * could also add healthcare legal framework here - gdpr, NHS NDOO etc, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caldicott_Report#Caldicott_principles">caldicott guardian/prinicples</a> and this https://www.england.nhs.uk/ig/ig-resources/ * this platform can be used for training for nhs data security - https://www.e-lfh.org.uk/programmes/data-security-awareness/ * Section 5 - writing collab documents add google docs here too, science communication - very wide - what do you mean? writing for wider audiences? using communication tools?</p>

<p>Last week has been dominated by the GitHub session and meetings with consortia members. All in all, both have been pretty good and I’m trying to fix the things that are less good ✨</p>
<p>I did notice, however, that I’ve not been making as much progress as I’d wanted to on some of the objectives I’d set for myself in my probation document (e.g.&nbsp;skill gaps, strategy to relaunch the ECR sessions). * EK - keep these tasks in mind and keep plugging away at them.</p>

<li>Getting better at doing things on GitHub 😊</li>
<li>Some things need to be changed/redone in terms of organising events.</li>
<li>I’ve been feeling a little overwhelmed - I’m making progress with understanding how things work but new things keep popping up!
<ul>
<li>EK - these are all great things and keep going with all of this introductory meetings and readings. It is going to feel a lot at the moment but will get better.</li>

<li>I haven’t been able to get into contributing to the Turing Way yet - it’d be nice to get some tips on getting involved?
<ul>
<li>EK - Don’t worry too much about doing anything specific at the moment - just try to come along to the turing way co-working on mondays and collaboration cafes if possible. The CM team often just go there to co-work on any work they are doing to get some company and chat to each other. This will probably then surface something you might want to get involved with.<br>

<li>Any tips on managing stress/feelings of being overwhelmed would be very welcome 😊</li>
