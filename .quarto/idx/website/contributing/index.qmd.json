We practice in this way so that we may support our communities in doing the same :).\n\nWe invite you to contribute to develop your own skill and practices with these tools.\n\n## Where to start\n\n==**Prerequisits, e.g. git, github accounts.

This means if you want create a Pull Request to edit the wiki, you will want to merge any branches with `gh-pages` rather than `main`.\n\n\n## Do I need to download any software to contribute?\n\nAt the moment - yes. You need a local install of Quarto to render `.qmd` files.\nSome IDEs already come included with Quarto:\n\n1. VSCode + [VSCode Quarto Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto)\n2. RStudio (comes with Quarto)\n\nOr you could download the [Quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/download/) if you like working on a terminal. \n\n#### Can I just edit directly on GitHub?\nSoon! We are working on integrating the Quarto GitHub Action and Deploy Preview to allow rendering and deployment entirely from with the GitHub repository.\n\n## How do I work with Quarto to edit the Wiki?\nWorking with Quarto is largely working with markdown files. \nWhere GitHub and HackMD use vanilla `.md` markdown files to write README files, Quarto has it's own flavour of markdown file called a `.qmd` file.\nIf you have ever edited a markdown file before, you will be at home with writing markdown files in Quarto - and this is *mostly* all you need to build this wiki.\n\n### The `_quarto.yml` file\nThe other important file for this Wiki, and for Quarto in general is the `_quarto.yml` file. \nThe reason you see links on the navigation bar, or sections on the left sidebar is because they are specified to look that way in the `_quarto.yml`.\n\n### File structure of the website\nThe `index.qmd` at the base of the repository serves the homepage. Any other sections on the website exist as a subdirectory of `_site/`. For example, the page you are viewing now is built from `_site/contributing/index.qmd`. In the `quarto.yml` file there will be a reference to this file path in the section that defines the top navigation pane.\n\n## I'm getting the hang of Quarto - what next?\nOnce you are comfortable editing `.qmd` files and slotting them into the `_quarto.yml` file, you can *change the way this wiki looks* by:\n\n1. Cloning the repository to your local desktop\n2. Create an switch to the new branch with `git checkout -b mynewbranch`\n3. Edit or create `.qmd` file(s)\n4. Make changes to the `_quarto.yml` file (if needed)\n5. Render the website (and show a preview):\n    - **In VSCode**:\n        Use the Quarto Extension and press \"Render\" when you have any `.qmd` file open\n    - **In RStudio**:\n        Press \"Render\" when you have any `.qmd` file open\n    - **On the Command Line**:\n        At the top of the local cloned directory you can run `quarto preview index.qmd` and this will provide you with a `localhost` URL that you can visit and check your changes.\n6. Push the change to GitHub `git push --set-upstream origin mynewbranch`\n7. In the Pull Request ensure that you are merging to the `gh-pages` branch, not the `main` branch.\n\n## Practice here!\nThis is an open space to pracice editing this repository :). Feel free to add your name, or favourite pizza topping in the space below and submit a Pull Request! \n\n* Cass thinks pinenuts make pizza a bit posh! \n\n\n\n\n::: callout-note\n##\nYou can also click on \"Edit this page\" on the right hand side of this page.
