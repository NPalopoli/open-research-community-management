# RCMs Participating in The Turing Way

All RCMs are onboarded as community members in *The Turing Way*.
As members of TPS, they are obliged to share practices from their work in _The Turing Way_ as chapters, resources or presentations/workshops.
This can be either generalised for domain independent use or communicated as case studies.
They should also contribute to the development, maintenance and sustainability of *The Turing Way* overall.
Some roles, responsibilities and engagement pathways have been described in the [roles for core members](./roles-of-core-members.md) document.
Also, see the [Ways of Working](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/blob/main/ways_of_working.md) in *The Turing Way*.

RCMs should also work with *The Turing Way* RCM to mentor and support the broader contributors community of *The Turing Way*.
This can be through sharing events and resources from their projects, identifying opportunities for collaboration and supporting their engagement in _The Turing Way_ events, GitHub repository or other activities.

## How do we use The Turing Way in our work?

The Turing RCMs facilitate the integration of reproducible, interoperable and collaborative processes in technical as well as the social infrastructure of the institute's research projects.
They use *The Turing Way* as a primary resource to enable access, documentation and sharing of data science and research best practices across the Turing institute and beyond.
Please find all useful links in the [quick links](./quick-links.md) document.
