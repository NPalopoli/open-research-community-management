# Open Research Community Management at The Alan Turing Institute

*Establishing cross-community collaborations and promoting open research in data science*

The [Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) programme at The Alan Turing Institute under the leadership of Dr. Kirstie Whitaker represents a cross-cutting set of initiatives which seek to build open source infrastructure that is accessible to all and to empower a global, decentralised network of people who connect data with domain experts.

Led by Dr. Malvika Sharan, TPS Senior Researcher for Open Research, TPS hosts a team of Community Managers funded by different projects at the Institute.
All Community Managers are brought together as the [Open Research Community Management](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems/community-management-and-open-research) team.
Members from within the Turing programmes working in similar positions, as well as members from projects collaborating with TPS/*The Turing Way* outside the Turing, referred to as "collaborators in community roles" in this document, are also invited to join this team.

All members of this team also participate in [*The Turing Way*](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) -- an Open Source, Open Collaboration and Community-driven guide to data science, co-led by Kirstie (who is also the founder of the project) and Malvika.
A part (~10%) of Community Managers' role involves engaging with and contributing to *The Turing Way* as core staff members of the project.
Anyone interested in the work of this team from outside the Turing or non-collaborators is invited to collaborate with us on *The Turing Way*.
For further questions and information, please get in touch with Malvika by emailing [msharan@turing.ac.uk](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk).

## Open Research Community Management Team

Members of the Open Research Community Management team are Community Managers and collaborators in community roles who invest in engaging, training and empowering a diverse group of members such as researchers, research engineers, programme/project management and the business side of the organisation.
They foster diverse Communities of Practice within and outside the Turing through community building and engagement roles in their respective projects. 

Through the active adoption of open research, reproducibility and collaborative approaches primarily drawn from [*The Turing Way*](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/), they contribute toward building interconnected systems of open source software, datasets, communities and processes.
The overarching mission is to make research open, reproducible, ethical, equitable and effective across the national and international data science ecosystem for commercial and public interest technologies alike.

## Background

Community building is a process of enabling members in our communities to move from the position of spectators or users to developers and leaders in the project.
Community managers and collaborators in community roles identify and build meaningful pathways for everyone to gain access to the skills and resources they need to participate in the community.
Among other project-specific and technical responsibilities, community managers take care of background work needed to make tangible and visible work of their communities effective. 
These background works involve approaches for collaboration, maintenance, acknowledgement and capturing the impact of community members' work.
As the word 'background' suggests, working in a community space often stays hidden and hence, can feel unsupported.
This is especially challenging when community managers don't have access to an appropriate support system or opportunities to exchange best practices with other community developers.

The **Open Research Community Management** team at The Alan Turing Institute provides a space for connection, support and skill-building for the community managers and collaborators in community roles working in participatory and community-oriented projects.

### Research Community Managers (RCM) at the Turing

The Turing RCMs join the [Tools, Practices and Systems](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) (TPS) Research Programme's [Open Research Community Management](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems/community-management-and-open-research) project.

They are assigned to specific projects where they collaborate closely with others and identify where they can surface implicit knowledge and make information explicitly available so that everyone who wants to can participate. 
As a team, we ensure that the research that happens at the Institute is created to be maintained, sustained, remixed and reused.

![People across different communities act as physical bridges between two separate projects and find mutually beneficial solutions. There is no replacement of people in technology.](https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/v2/867e0f11-b7cb-460e-9c3b-487ac75ada36:849be739-8880-41cc-a487-215fb325d91f:people-find-solutions.jpg/full/750,/0/default.jpg)

## Members and Collaborators

Please note, that this team is constituted of the Turing staff members who have dedicated responsibilities towards different projects within the organisation, often on behalf of the TPS research programme.
Members from the community or participatory projects currently collaborating with TPS or *The Turing Way* are very welcome to join this team.
All resources created by them in their projects will be shared using open science and FAIR (Findable, Accesible, Interoperable, Reusable) practices, while following the principle of "as open as possible, as closed as necessary", especially when working with sensitive data. Practices and case studies learned from their work with be included in *The Turing Way*.

New Community Managers at the Turing and collaborators in community positions will be onboarded in Open Research Community Management team by the project lead and added as a contributor to this project repository.
Please [create an issue for your induction](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/community-manager-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=onboarding&template=NEW_MEMBERS.md&title=%5BINDUCTION%5D) (if not already created by the project lead).

If you are not already collaborating with TPS, but are interested in community management, please contact [Malvika Sharan](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk) who can invite you to internal training for her team members.
You are, of course, encouraged to join *The Turing Way* that she co-leads alongside Kirstie Whitaker.

## Guiding Principles

- Maintain **respect, empathy and integrity** in the team and the communities we build.
- Prioritise **diversity, equity and inclusion** in all our work.
- **Share knowledge** about the scientific communities you coordinate and the issue you are seeking to address.
- Actively **create and identify future opportunities** to enable collaboration and integration of open research practices to co-create additional knowledge.
- Provide **access to resources that empower and enable** each other to discover, display and directly use their knowledge and skills. 
- Contribute to the ongoing **professional development of team members** by maximising opportunities for collaborative work, their careers, and open research at large.
- Create a **safe and non-judgemental environment** to engage each other, celebrate successes, admit errors and draw learnings from our mistakes.
- Be willing to **work through conflicts to resolution**.
- Ensure that **transparent reporting practices and effective communications** become a regular and ongoing component of our community-building process.
- Collaborate with individuals and institutions beyond the team that **expand and extend our mission for open Research Community Management**.

To realise these principles, build shared perspectives that underpin these guiding principles (taken from _Bassler, A. et al., "Developing Effective Citizen Engagement: A How-to Guide for Community Leaders." Center for Rural Pennsylvania, 2008_.):

- **Change is a fundamental** part of growth and effective change must come from within individuals and groups. 
- Community engagement/growth **starts by first changing ourselves**, our attitudes, language and the way we view the world around us.
- Communities are most successful when true partnerships exist and **power or control is delegated and vested effectively** within the community.

### Working with *The Turing Way*

All members of the Open Research Community Management team should take time to learn details in [*The Turing Way* core documents](./the-turing-way-core).
All community managers are onboarded as the core staff members of The *Turing Way* as part of their time is allocated to TPS and *The Turing Way*. 

Their engagement with *The Turing Way* project and community should help them understand how they can:
- enable reproducibility, open communication and ethical research in their projects and Communities of Practice they build.
- identify people, projects and resources that are crucial for the development, maintenance and sustainability of their projects.
- interconnect their work with other projects and communities in the wider landscape of data science and open research.
- facilitate openness, collaboration and transparent reporting, even when not all components of their projects can be made public.
- find support for their community work and in exchange support others' work, especially when it is closely aligned with their projects.
- enhance their technical understanding required in their work and share them more widely via *The Turing Way* (chapters, tutorials, templates or events).
