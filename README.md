# Open Research Community Management at The Alan Turing Institute

*Integrating open science practices through community engagement*

The [Tools, Practices and Systems (TPS)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems) programme at The Alan Turing Institute under the leadership of Dr Kirstie Whitaker represents a cross-cutting set of initiatives which seek to build open source infrastructure that is accessible to all and to empower a global, decentralised network of people who connect data with domain experts.

Led by Dr Malvika Sharan, TPS Senior Researcher for Open Research, TPS hosts the [Open Research Community Management](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-programmes/tools-practices-and-systems/community-management-and-open-research) team with all Research Community Managers (RCMs) working across multiple teams, projects and programmes at the Institute.

All members of this team also participate in [*The Turing Way*](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) -- an Open Source, Open Collaboration and Community-driven guide to data science, co-led by Kirstie (who is also the founder of the project) and Malvika.
Part of the Research Community Managers' role is to engage with and contribute to *The Turing Way* as TPS staff members of the project.

Members from within the Turing programmes working in similar positions, as well as members from projects collaborating with TPS/*The Turing Way* outside the Turing, referred to as "collaborators in community roles" in this document, are invited to join this team based on formal project or team-based collaboration.
Anyone interested in the work of this team from outside the Turing or non-collaborators is invited to collaborate with us on *The Turing Way*.
For further questions and information, please get in touch with Malvika by emailing [msharan@turing.ac.uk](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk).

## Background

Building communities in data science is crucial for bringing together diverse stakeholders, enabling knowledge exchange and co-creating a collaborative system in which AI research can thrive.​ At the Turing, this vision is realised by the integration of Research Community Managers (RCMs) in projects where multiple internal and external stakeholders are involved. As the visible and most connected members of the project, they apply Open Research and Community Management approaches to foster Communities of Practice in the Turing’s work.

> Research Community Managers empower the diverse stakeholders of a research community to co-create, maintain and sustain data science projects and outputs that they can equitably benefit from.

RCMs at the Turing embed open, inclusive and reproducible research practices in teams, projects and programmes they are involved in. Through collaboration, upskilling and resource development, RCMs build a shared understanding of research goals, roadmap and processes for everyone. They collaborate closely with different stakeholders and make implicit knowledge explicit so that everyone who wants to can participate.

## About the Team

The TPS Research Programme hosts all RCMs within the **Open Research Community Management** team.
As community experts, each RCM is assigned to specific projects across different programmes and as a team, they connect them as a joint-up system of open source and reproducible software, data, people and processes. 
By sharing knowledge as they develop in different projects, both in terms of scientific outcomes and socio-technical approaches applied to achieve them, RCMs break down the silos that traditionally exist in a research environment.

![the illustration shows three siloed groups of users, researchers and developers, who are connecting with each other based on commonly useful projects.](https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/v2/867e0f11-b7cb-460e-9c3b-487ac75ada36:1794300f-5dd7-47ac-af5a-007cc1b52bee:community-managers.jpg/full/750,/0/default.jpg)

RCMs combine a range of socio-technical skills including domain research expertise, scientific communications and stakeholder engagement approaches. 
Among others, their core responsibilities include ensuring access to skills and resources different people and groups within the project need to meaningfully participate and build something greater than the sum of its part. 
They provide information and processes for enabling members in our communities to move from the position of spectators or users to developers and leaders in the project.
RCMs facilitate open and collaborative work of others, while often taking care of many background works needed to make tangible and visible work of their communities possible. 
They embed best practices for ensuring EDIA (Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, Accessibility), collaboration, maintenance, acknowledgement and the impact of community-based work.
As a team, RCMs conduct research, build shared frameworks, create opportunities for skill-building and provide appropriate support systems for each other to exchange best practices from their work.

![People across different communities act as physical bridges between two separate projects and find mutually beneficial solutions. There is no replacement of people in technology.](https://zenodo.org/api/iiif/v2/867e0f11-b7cb-460e-9c3b-487ac75ada36:849be739-8880-41cc-a487-215fb325d91f:people-find-solutions.jpg/full/750,/0/default.jpg)

## Members and Collaborators

The **Open Research Community Management** team members are RCMs who are TPS researchers at the Turing staff who provide community management across different teams, projects and programmes in the organisation, often involving statkeholders from different groups and institutes.
The team also hosts a few members with community-oriented roles currently collaborating with TPS or *The Turing Way*

All resources needed to support their roles created in the RCM team, or the project they involve in will be shared on this repository (by removing any project-specific sensitive information).
All members are supported to open science and FAIR (Findable, Accesible, Interoperable, Reusable) practices, while following the principle of "as open as possible, as closed as necessary", especially when working with sensitive data. 
Practices and case studies learned from their work with be shared in *The Turing Way* wherever possible.

New RCMs at the Turing and collaborators in community roles will be onboarded in Open Research Community Management team by the project lead and added as a contributor to this project repository.
Please [create an issue for your induction](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/community-manager-team/issues/new?assignees=&labels=onboarding&template=NEW_MEMBERS.md&title=%5BINDUCTION%5D) (if not already created by the project lead).

If you are not already collaborating with TPS, but are interested in community management, please contact [Malvika Sharan](mailto:msharan@turing.ac.uk) who can invite you to internal training for her team members.
You are, of course, encouraged to join *The Turing Way* that she co-leads alongside Kirstie Whitaker.

## Guiding Principles

- Maintain **respect, empathy and integrity** in the team and the communities we build.
- Prioritise **diversity, equity and inclusion** in all our work.
- **Share knowledge** about the scientific communities you coordinate and the issue you are seeking to address.
- Actively **create and identify future opportunities** to enable collaboration and integration of open research practices to co-create additional knowledge.
- Provide **access to resources that empower and enable** each other to discover, display and directly use their knowledge and skills. 
- Contribute to the ongoing **professional development of team members** by maximising opportunities for collaborative work, their careers, and open research at large.
- Create a **safe and non-judgemental environment** to engage each other, celebrate successes, admit errors and draw learnings from our mistakes.
- Be willing to **work through conflicts to resolution**.
- Ensure that **transparent reporting practices and effective communications** become a regular and ongoing component of our community-building process.
- Collaborate with individuals and institutions beyond the team that **expand and extend our mission for open Research Community Management**.

To realise these principles, build shared perspectives that underpin these guiding principles (taken from _Bassler, A. et al., "Developing Effective Citizen Engagement: A How-to Guide for Community Leaders." Center for Rural Pennsylvania, 2008_.):

- **Change is a fundamental** part of growth and effective change must come from within individuals and groups. 
- Community engagement/growth **starts by first changing ourselves**, our attitudes, language and the way we view the world around us.
- Communities are most successful when true partnerships exist and **power or control is delegated and vested effectively** within the community.

### Working with *The Turing Way*

All members of the Open Research Community Management team should take time to learn details in [*The Turing Way* core documents](./the-turing-way-core).
All community managers are onboarded as the core staff members of The *Turing Way* as part of their time is allocated to TPS and *The Turing Way*. 

Their engagement with *The Turing Way* project and community should help them understand how they can:
- enable reproducibility, open communication and ethical research in their projects and Communities of Practice they build.
- identify people, projects and resources that are crucial for the development, maintenance and sustainability of their projects.
- interconnect their work with other projects and communities in the wider landscape of data science and open research.
- facilitate openness, collaboration and transparent reporting, even when not all components of their projects can be made public.
- find support for their community work and in exchange support others' work, especially when it is closely aligned with their projects.
- enhance their technical understanding required in their work and share them more widely via *The Turing Way* (chapters, tutorials, templates or events).
